"307927"	"Argentina News Roundup: 3rd February 2014"	"Today's news from Argentina: Government meets with grain exporters; new bill against police strikes in Córdoba; slave labour found in north-eastern provinces."	"Chief of Cabinet Jorge Capitanich (Photo: Daniel Dabove/Télam/lz) Government Meets with Grain Exporters: After Friday’s verbal confrontation between Chief of Cabinet Jorge Capitanich and representatives from large agricultural companies over grain exports, the two parties met today to find a breakthrough. Upon exiting the meeting, Capitanich tweeted that: “We have finalised the meeting with the main grain exporting businesses, where we could observe they have interpreted that the exchange rate is stable, interest rates accompany this decision and the future price of soy will be US$40 lower in the near future. This means there are objective conditions for the immediate sale of the accumulated harvest and that perspectives for future harvests are auspicious,” suggesting that an agreement may have been reached. In his daily press conference, before the meeting, Capitanich had threatened to apply sanctions against grain companies, saying that “there’s always the sanctioning power of the state to generate the conditions to preserve the general interest of Argentines.” The Chief of Cabinet also confirmed via Twitter that they will hold another meeting before the end of the week. New Bill Against Police Strikes in Córdoba: Córdoba Governor José Manuel de la Sota announced on Saturday that he will submit a bill to the provincial congress seeking to prevent “insubordinate behaviour” within the police force. If passed, the bill stipulates that all police personnel who displays insubordinate behaviour, abandons their post, or presents demands “in a hostile or tumultuous way” will be dismissed, regardless of their rank. The bill also proposes the creation of a ‘Police Welfare Council’, which will “receive, analyse, and evaluate the different initiatives regarding working conditions and pay for all the police officers,” offering an alternative to police unionisation, which the governor called “unviable.” The third aspect of the bill concerns the creation of an ‘Anti-Drug Trafficking Police Force’, defined by De la Sota as “a specialised organisation which will report directly to the [province's] general prosecutor,” and which will relieve the provincial police from handling drug-related cases, after the scandal that broke last year linking high-ranking police officers to drug traffickers. The announcements, which come two months after a police protest in Córdoba sparked a nationwide debate, were made during the opening of the 2014 parliamentary sessions. Slave Labour in the North-East:  The National Registry of Agricultural Workers and Employers (Renatea) found 32 rural workers living in “extremely precarious” conditions at a yerba mate plantation property of a former Misiones governor. The government body, which reports to the Ministry of Labour, carried out a number of inspections in the north-eastern provinces of Corrientes and Misiones. In the latter, they conducted an inspection at a yerba mate plantation, ‘Estancia I Pora’, owned by former governor Ramón Puerta, where they found 32 people living “in conditions of extreme precariousness: camping tents worked as bedrooms, with mattresses on the floor. Also, they did not have sanitary or cooking facilities.” A 14-year old child was found working at the plantation. Puerta, who was interim president of the country for three days in December 2001, will be sued for people trafficking. Renatea’s inspections also found 29 unregistered workers -two of them minors- living and working in precarious conditions in two forestry establishments in the nearby province of Corrientes."

"380100"	"Latin America News Roundup: 12th February 2014"	"Today's news from the region: Referendum on Bogotá Mayor postponed; regularisation plan for undocumented Haitians announced; human remains found in Uruguayan police station."	"Mayor of Bogotá, Gustavo Petro (Photo: Wikipedia) Colombia – Referendum on Bogotá Mayor Postponed: Colombia’s National Civil Registry announced yesterday that the recall referendum on Bogotá Mayor Gustavo Petro has been postponed due to “lack of resources.” The referendum, which will decide on the mayor’s fate after he was dismissed by Colombia’s Inspector General, was scheduled to take place on 2nd March. However, the Civil Registry informed in a statement posted on their website, that “without the resources it is not possible to move forward in purchasing the necessary goods and services” to carry it out. The Civil Registry has requested COL$38bn (US$17.8m) from the Economy Ministry, and is still awaiting for the funds to be confirmed. There has been no confirmation as to when the referendum will be held. Regularisation Plan for Undocumented Haitians: The Haitian government has announced it will launch a survey of undocumented Haitian citizens living in other countries, including neighbouring Dominican Republic. Haiti’s National Identification Office (ONI) will deploy a number of mobile units around Dominican Republic in order to identify undocumented citizens living there and help them regularise their situation. The process will be carried out by Haitian civil servants and members of the Haitian diaspora in Dominican Republic, according to ONI’s director Jean Baptiste Saint-Cyr, though he did not specify whether the Dominican government will also be involved. The survey, which will start next month, will also include Suriname and the Turks and Caicos Islands. The announcement is the result of the dialogue established by the Haitian and Dominican governments after the decision by the Dominican Constitutional Tribunal to strip Haitians of the country’s citizenship. A bill by the Committee of Solidarity with Denationalised People, which proposed to grant citizenship to all people of foreign ascent born in Dominican territory between 1929 and 2010, was introduced in the Dominican parliament. Uruguay – Human Remains Found in Police Station: Human bones thought to belong to two people disappeared during the last military dictatorship (1973-1985) were found yesterday in a police station in Montevideo. The human remains were found by workers doing excavation works in police station number 8 of the Uruguayan capital. Supreme Court spokesman, Raúl Oxandabarat, explained that “the first characteristics of the findings seem to indicate that there is the possibility that it could be a case of burial of people who were detained and disappeared.” The court will be in charge of conducting DNA tests which will be matched against a registry of disappeared prisoners. A report by anthropologist Horacio Solla found that the bones would have been buried around 30 years ago, or more, and would belong to a man and a woman."

"575221"	"Latin America News Roundup: 12th March 2014"	"Today's news from Latin America: Chilean president Michelle Bachelet announces first policies; Paraguayan unions call for general strike; media giants face limits in Mexico."	"Bachelet with Argentine president Cristina Fernández (left) and Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff (right) at her inauguration (photo: Presidencia/Télam/ddc) Chile – President Bachelet Announces First Policies: President Michelle Bachelet, who was sworn in for a second term yesterday, announced she has submitted her first two bills to Congress. The first measure is the creation of the ‘March Bonus’, a US$40 yearly payment for low income families. “It’s not just about a payment on a month we know brings with it many expenses,” said Bachelet, “it is about the conviction that all our actions must be aimed at facing the [country's] huge inequalities.” The second bill re-establishes a similar yearly payment in the winter months, called the ‘Winter Bonus’, which had been implemented during her first term (2006-2010) and later eliminated by former president Sebastián Piñera. The policies would benefit some 1.6m families, according to government calculations. Upon taking office, Bachelet promised to deliver 50 of her campaign promises within the first 100 days of her government. Paraguay – Unions Announce General Strike: Representatives from the main Paraguayan unions have called for a strike on 26th March, the first to take place during Horacio Cartes’ presidency. Workers are demanding higher wages and the implementation of “an economic, productive, and agro-ecological model that serves the majorities” rather than the corporations. Earlier this month, the government established a 10% increase in the minimum wage, whilst unions were asking for a 25% increase. Other reasons put forward for the strike, which the unions say was necessary because “the government refuses to negotiate,” are the demand to end the public-private alliance to carry out public works, to end of the “criminalisation of social struggle”, and to obtain freedom for the “political prisoners” from the Curuguaty Massacre. The government responded by saying the strike is politically motivated, as it has been supported by the opposition Liberal Party. Mexico – Limits to Media Concentration: The Telecommunications Institute forced the country’s main media groups to allow new competitors to enter the business. The body’s resolution categorised Televisa and Grupo Carso, owned by businessman Carlos Slim, as the “main economic agents” in telecommunications and broadcasting. For this reason, it determined that they will have to share part of their infrastructure with their competitors offering a public rate. Also, Televisa will no longer have exclusive broadcasting rights for relevant content, such as football championships and the World Cup. Televisa itself announced it has been forced to “make its broadcasting infrastructure available to third parties in a non-discriminatory and non-exclusive manner.” It was also announced that two new frequencies for open air television will be put up for tender. Televisa is the largest media company in the Spanish speaking world, whilst Carlos Slim’s group is one of the leaders in the telecommunications market with companies such as América Movil, Telcel, Telmex, Embratel, Claro, and KPN Telecom, amongst others. Last December, the Federal Telecommunications Institute of Mexico left Televisa and TV Azteca out of the tender for new television channels due to their dominant position “in a highly concentrated market.” Story courtesy of Agencia Púlsar."

"584485"	"Argentina News Roundup: 13th March 2014"	"Today's news from Argentina: US won't back government on debt holdouts; Pope Francis celebrates 1st anniversary; YPF talks of an Argentine energy revolution"	"US Secretary of State John Kerry said the US would not back Argentina on holdouts (photo courtesy of Wikipedia) United States won’t back Government on Holdouts: US Secretary of State, John Kerry, has rejected the possibility that the US government would side with Argentina in the dispute over the holdouts on 2001-2 debt payments. Responding a Republican congressman’s question over whether the State Department would take a stance in favour of Argentina if the court required an opinion, he said “No, we wouldn’t”, going on to say that the US would continue pressuring Argentina to pay its creditors, both the public and private ones. He made particular reference to the US$600m that Argentina owes the US State – part of the US$9bn Paris Club debt – saying: “I’ll do everything in my power to get it back, as will the State Department.” The response comes as a blow to Argentina’s government, who had speculated that the Obama administration’s official position would back Argentina, with even Foreign Minister Héctor Timmerman have publicly mooted US backing.  Pope Francis Celebrates 1st Anniversary: Today marked the one year since the Vatican nominated Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio of Buenos Aires to be the 266th pope, who took the name Pope Francis. The leader of the Catholic Church marked the day by tweeting “Pray for me”, a phrase he used when making his first appearance as pontiff, on the central balcony of St Peter’s Basilica a year ago, and one he often used as the end of discourses when in Argentina. Cabinet Chief Jorge Capitanich said that today “is a very important day for Argentina”, speaking of a “revolution of being“, and of the transformation of “spiritual leadership of Catholics and non-Catholics in the world”, highlighting that Pope Francis is the first Argentine and Latin American pope. In celebration of the anniversary, Buenos Aires metropolitan cathedral will hold a special mass today at 8pm, presided over by his successor, Cardinal Mario Poli. Head of YPF Talks of Energy Revolution: Head of YPF, Miguel Galuccio, today said that Argentina has the energy reserves to not only recuperate energy supply, but to also undergo an “energy revolution”. He said that the country must decide if it wants to be “energy independent or dependent”, highlighting the recently discovered oil reserves, and also the country’s vast gas fields. He went on to highlight that since the government expropriated the company from Spanish oil giant Repsol in April 2012, investment has risen 130% and net profit 45%. The announcement comes at a time when other countries in Latin America are beginning to invest more in renewable energy, something that has dropped dramatically in Argentina – falling from US$500m to US$90m between 2012 and 2013 – since the discovery of more oil and gas reserves over the past couple of years."

"526712"	"Criminal Code Reform: A Debate in the Making"	"The draft bill for a new Criminal Code is yet to be sent to Congress, but it has already sparked a heated debate. Celina Andreassi explains the key changes in the 'revolutionary' reform."	"The draft bill for a new Criminal Code is yet to be officially released and sent to Congress, but it has already sparked a heated debate. Whilst the draft sits with President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, who will study it before submitting it to Congress for debate and approval, a preliminary copy was leaked, showing the main changes proposed by the new Criminal Code. The latest controversy came yesterday, when Frente Renovador (FR) deputy Sergio Massa reiterated his proposal to carry out a referendum in order to approve the new Code, which, he said, “is made to benefit criminals.” The committee presents the draft bill to President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (photo: Raúl Ferrari:Télam:cf) Some History The foundations of Argentina’s current Criminal Code date back to 1921, though it has undergone several modifications – around 900, according to estimates – throughout the years. These sometimes haphazard changes are what prompted President Fernández to form a committee made up of representatives from different political parties and presided over by Supreme Court judge Raúl Zaffaroni. The members of the committee are former judge and minister León Arslanián, constitutional lawyer and former UCR deputy Ricardo Gil Lavedra, former Socialist deputy María Elena Barbagelata, and PRO deputy Federico Pinedo. It was formed by presidential decree in May 2012, with the aim to “reform, update, and integrate criminal legislation into a single body of law” that restores the code’s “original coherence”. The Criminal Code project follows on from the comprehensive Civil Code reform being debated in Congress since 2012, and come before forthcoming reforms to the Criminal Procedure and Administrative Codes, announced by the president in the opening of Congress’ 2014 sessions on Saturday. After two years’ work, the committee in full presented the draft bill to President Fernández on 13th February. Zaffaroni considered the new version to be “revolutionary”, as the current code “has a number of reforms that make it inapplicable.” Supreme Court judge Raúl Zaffaroni presided over the reform committee (photo: José Romero:Télam:jcp) Sentences The criticisms aimed at the draft code by the likes of Massa are consistent with, and build upon, the usual criticism aimed at Zaffaroni himself for his support of ‘guarantism’, a liberal school of thought developed by Italian jurist Luigi Ferrajoli which places great emphasis on the recognition and protection of the individuals’ rights and constitutional guarantees. In criminal law, this translates to the defence of personal freedom against arbitrary interventions by the judicial system. The draft code has been criticised mainly for decreasing jail terms and removing the concept of recidivism (repeat offending) as an aggravating factor in sentencing. One of the main problems with the “chaotic” legal criminal system currently in place, is the lack of proportionality in jail terms. As such, it was an important task of the committee to re-organise the length of the punishment for different crimes in order to make the scale more coherent -that is, to give tougher sentences for more serious crimes and shorter sentences -or even no sentences at all- for lesser crimes. Members of the committee have defended this decision by pointing out that, while it is true that some sentences are now shorter, others have been lengthened. The main changes on this regard are: - Life sentence -which exists nominally in the current code but is not applied in practice- is eliminated. - The maximum jail term is reduced from 35 to 30 years, in line with the Rome Statute, and is applicable to crimes against humanity. - Parole is eliminated, and replaced with alternatives to prison, such as house arrest, weekend arrest, community service, fines, and limitations to a convict’s mobility. This does not apply to serious crimes. - Recidivism (repeat offending) is eliminated. Currently, its only use is to limit access to parole. Without parole, all terms will be served in full, either in prison or using any of the alternatives described above. - Judges can reduce or eliminate prison sentences in certain cases, such as when the ‘insignificance’ principle is applied (if the damage caused is irrelevant or simply a nuisance), when there is a ‘natural punishment’ (ie, the consequences of the crime caused physical or emotional damage to the accused that count as part of the punishment), or when the crime involves an indigenous community that has executed its own “solution processes” (though this does not apply to serious crimes). Crimes As for the definitions and re-definitions of the different types of crimes, some of the main innovations are: - Crimes against humanity are included in the Criminal Code, as a specific category. They include genocide, forced disappearance, and others as specified in the Rome Statute, as well as war crimes. In line with international law, these crimes are not subject to statute of limitations or prescription. - Torture “by omission” is penalised, including the cases of those who do not interrupt the act of torture or report it, having the chance to do so. - Fellatio and rape within a marriage are explicitly mentioned as punishable cases of rape. - Environmental crimes -such as pollution or attacks on animals- and cyber-crimes -such a identity theft- are included in the Criminal Code. - Possession and/or cultivation of drugs for personal use is decriminalised, as per a recent Supreme Court ruling. - Abortion legislation is not modified, but the text is clarified to avoid common interpretation problems. On this point, committee members stated that they specifically avoided making changes – as requested by Barbagelata – as past experiences have shown that “the inclusion of decriminalisation or criminalisation of abortion has interfered with the debate regarding the other items to be reformed, often making the whole project fail.” Opposition deptuy Sergio Massa is a vocal critic of the new bill (photo: Wikipedia) The Repercussions Even though the draft bill was presented to the president almost three weeks ago, it was only this week, after she mentioned it on Saturday’s address before Congress, that it started making the headlines. Massa led the charge against the proposed code, safe in the knowledge that his party was not involved in drafting it. After a few months of relatively low public exposure, his criticism of the project and his intention to carry out a referendum on it propelled him back into the limelight. According to the congressional deputy, his reasons for opposing the draft are that “it removes recidivism, decreases jail terms for 146 crimes, and diminshes crimes such as kidnapping, aggravated crimes, torture, trafficking, proxenetism.” With regards to the committee, he said that “they wrote a text, now they need to explain to society why eight out of ten crimes can benefit from probation. That requires a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer.” The answers came from all sides of the political spectrum. Committee coordinator Roberto Carlés explained in an article published by Página 12 that the draft includes 85 new offences, reduces 116 penalty ranges and decriminalises 17 former offences, but also raises jail terms for 159 crimes. He also criticised Massa’s limited understanding of constitutional law, as the Argentine Constitution does not allow for popular initiatives on matters related to criminal law, and the doctrine extends this to referendums. Zaffaroni took Massa’s statement as a “defamation, rather than criticism”, as “any ordinary citizen that listens to what he’s saying may well believe that we are five irresponsible lunatics.” He clarified that “issues such as probation and detention pending trial are ruled by [provincial] criminal procedures’ codes, and not by the Criminal Code.” UCR’s Gil Lavedra, in turn, called Massa’s stance a case of politically motivated “demagogic opportunism”. “The opportunistic use of sensationalist expressions makes me think the [2015 presidential] election campaign has already begun,” he said. Controversy has extended to within the UCR as well. Despite having Gil Lavedra as co-author of the draft Code, some party members, such as Julio Cobos, have expressed their discontent with the proposed bill along similar lines as Massa. As the committee members have pointed out, what the executive is currently studying is merely a first draft. It is still to be reviewed by the president and the Justice Ministry before it can be submitted as a bill to Congress, where it will be debated and possibly modified. With this in mind, committee member and PRO deputy Federico Pinedo suggested that, rather that opposing the project, Massa should “do his best possible work,” because “it is the job of lawmakers to pass good laws.”"	"Analysis; News From Argentina; TOP STORY; criminal code; federico pinedo; raul zaffaroni; reform; ricardo gil lavedra; Sergio Massa"	"http://www.argentinaindependent.com/currentaffairs/analysis/criminal-code-reform-debate-making/"	"2014-03-06 00:20:34"	"2014-03-06 00:04:56"	"85"	"General"	"argentina independent"

"432270"	"Editorial: A Change of Strategy by Venezuela’s Opposition"	"Celina Andreassi analyses the recent upheaval in Venezuela, arguing that the tension derives from a change in strategy by the fragmented opposition."	"It is near impossible for people outside of Venezuela to know what’s really going on, on a day-to-day basis, with the recent protests. It is probably difficult for people in Venezuela to know for sure. Media coverage, on both sides, is disgracefully partial. Social networks are teeming with outright lies and fake photographs picked up, without any prior verification, by local and international media. However certain things, such as longer-term trends, can be more easily analysed from afar. A question that can be asked by those attempting to understand what is happening in Venezuela is: what is the opposition trying to do? Protests in Altamira, Caracas (photo: José Romero/Télam/lz) If one thing is clear, is that at one point the opposition changed the strategy it had been applying during the first half of the chavista cycle. After a failed coup (2002), an economic sabotage (2003-2004), a lost recall referendum (2004), and a misguided legislative boycott (2005), the Venezuelan opposition understood they needed two things: to join forces, and to play by the rules. Squeaky clean Henrique Capriles won the opposition’s primary elections to become the face, and the leader, of this new stage in Venezuelan politics. He represented an opposition united under the MUD banner (Mesa de Unidad Democrática) and whilst he was extremely critical of the government of the late Hugo Chávez – there is no room for grey areas in Venezuelan politics – he toned down the aggressive, destructive rhetoric significantly. During this period, the opposition did as well as they ever would under chavismo. Last April, barely a month after Chávez’s death, Capriles came extremely close to becoming Venezuela’s president, and to ending a 15-year hegemony. However, the local elections held in December showed an important loss of support for MUD, which only managed to win in 75 districts (out of 317), and whose national vote fell from 49.1% -in April- to 39.3%. These disappointing results seem to have put a dent in the consensus that held the MUD together, prompting more radicalised groups within it to take matters into their own hands. A recent encounter between President Nicolás Maduro and Capriles -who is governor of Miranda state-, which could have anticipated the beginning of a more civilised cohabitation between government and opposition, was possibly the last straw for these groups. Venezuelan opposition leader Leopoldo López, handing himself in to the National Guard. (Photo: AFP/ Juan Barreto/Télam/lz) The protagonist of the last few days has not been Capriles, but Leopoldo López, who has been explicitly calling for the “exit” of Maduro. National deputy Maria Corina Machado has also become quite prominent. Both of them were actively involved in 2002′s failed coup against Hugo Chávez, have close ties with the US, and López has been linked to former Colombian president Alvaro Uribe. What the opposition had in economic power and support from the elites, it lacked in street presence. Here’s where the students come in. As Dr. Julia Buxton points out in a recent article, students from private universities in Venezuela have been trained and financially supported by the opposition’s traditional ally – the US – since as early as 2008. Since, a number of protests have served as a build-up to last week’s Youth Day demonstrations, in which they colluded with members of the political opposition such as López and Machado. Indeed, US support of Venezuelan opposition is a story on its own. It is nothing new, and the government is very aware of this, as this week’s expulsion of three US diplomats from Venezuela shows. Back in 2002, George W. Bush’s administration was quick to justify the illegitimate and short-lived government of Pedro Carmona that resulted from a military coup, and it has been alleged that it at the very least it knew about -if not cooperated directly with- the coup. Buxton estimates the combined financial support from US institutions to Venezuelan opposition groups since 2002 in as much as US$45m, much of it aimed at ‘youth outreach programmes’, whilst researcher Mark Weisbrot mentions the US$5m earmarked in the federal budget “for funding opposition activities inside Venezuela”. Existing everyday problems faced by Venezuelan society, such as insecurity, high inflation, and shortages -probably caused by a mix of economic sabotage and the ineffectiveness of an increasingly hypertrophied and corrupt state- were used as excuses for the students’ mobilisations. However, these are situations that have existed for some time now, that have not lost the government any elections, and where no significant changes have been verified in recent times. The most recent objective change in Venezuela’s situation seems to be within the opposition, rather than the government. So, what are López and company trying to achieve? Whilst they talk about pushing for Maduro’s “exit”, it has been profusely pointed out that the opposition does not have the support of the armed forces, so attempting a traditional coup d’êtat or a strategy based on street violence can only result in a -probably ineffective- bloodbath. President Nicolás Maduro addresses a multitude of oil workers who marched in the capital in support of the government on Tuesday. (Photo: Presidencia Venezuela/Télam/dsl) They have definitely appealed to the international public opinion by intensifying the smear campaign the international press has been waging on the Venezuelan government for years. However, it’s uncertain how this could have an immediate impact on the local situation, especially since regional organisations and neighbouring governments have closed ranks behind the defence of institutional stability in Venezuela. Chris Gilbert, professor at the Bolivarian University of Venezuela, seems to hit the nail in the head when he explains that the opposition is thinking in the medium-to-long term, as they face an “electoral plateau”, i.e., a period of almost two years without elections, where the government can focus on governing rather than campaigning. Talking about López and Machado, Gilbert points out that they “are not mistaken in thinking that, through violent street actions, they could salvage the opposition as some kind of political reference, nationally and internationally, and perhaps enhance their own leadership within its files”, looking out to the elections in late 2015. The constant tension would wear down not just the public opinion, but also the government, already weakened since Chávez’s death by factional struggles and doubts over the leadership of Maduro. It could also backfire, and strengthen the government’s grassroots support. In any case, and as the five victims left by the conflict in the past week show, this destabilisation attempt is certainly a very expensive way to try to win an election. @tbcelina"	"Analysis; Current Affairs; TOP STORY; Coup d'etat; henrique capriles; Leopoldo López; maria corina machado; Nicolas Maduro; opposition; venezuela"	"http://www.argentinaindependent.com/currentaffairs/editorial-change-strategy-venezuelas-opposition/"	"2014-02-20 19:00:36"	"2014-02-20 18:24:56"	"85"	"General"	"argentina independent"
"489618"	"Argentina News Roundup: 28th February 2014"	"Today's news from Argentina: child workers rescued from tobacco plantations in Jujuy; tension and uncertainty over eviction order in Villa Lugano; Mauricio Macri opens 'Challenging Year' for Buenos Aires legislature."	"Children discovered working at the ‘Los Avalos’ tobacco plantation in Jujuy (photo courtesy of AFIP) Child Workers Rescued From Tobacco Plantation in Jujuy: Inspectors from the tax office AFIP discovered yesterday four children aged between 11 and 15 who had been working at a tobacco plantation in the province of Jujuy. The children had been working alongside nine adults – of which seven were not registered – while another 15 minors and other adults are estimated to have escaped the El Tipal ranch when the inspectors arrived. The workers lived in unsanitary houses and were not given adequate safety equipment to carry out their tasks. The discovery comes two weeks after AFIP inspectors found eight child slave workers at another tobacco plantation in Jujuy. The children at Los Ávalos ranch worked eight-hour days without receiving a salary and without protective clothing. In both cases, the owners of the plantations face charges of using child labour, a crime punishable with up to 15 years in prison. Tension and Uncertainty Over Villa Lugano Eviction Order: Tensions are rising in Villa Lugano, where around 200 people have been given until 7pm this evening to vacate a plot of land that they have occupied since Monday night. After negotiations failed this morning, Judge Gabriel Vega ordered the “immediate and peaceful” eviction of the land, while guaranteeing the rights and safety of children and disabled people that are among the group. Families occupying the land said they would not move. “There are parents with small children, young people, old people, and we are not moving,” one of the occupiers told Página 12 earlier today. “The judge will be held responsible if we are injured or killed.” The eviction order is to be carried out by the Metropolitan Police, with national Security Secretary Sergio Berni saying that the Federal Police and Gendarmerie forces would not be involved in the operation. This afternoon, Metropolitan police officers at the location urged people to “evacuate peacefully to avoid an escalation of violence.” Macri Opens Legislative Sessions in Buenos Aires: Mayor Mauricio Macri inaugurated the legislative year in the city of Buenos Aires this morning with a pledge to work together with the national government on “common issues”. “The president can count on someone who, despite numerous differences, will collaborate to ensure 2014 will find social peace,” said Macri, in a 20-minute speech. The mayor also indicated that he was in dialogue with the governor of Buenos Aires province, Daniel Scioli, about issues that affect the entire metropolitan area. Macri also announced that the Metrobus network would continue to expand in 2014, while new subte stations would be opened on the H line. Opposition legislators criticised the speech as “superficial”. “Macri avoided talking about the things most porteños are concerned about,” said Legislator for Frente para la Victoria (FpV), Jorge Taiana, adding that the mayor spoke of a “city without problems” when there are “major deficiencies in housing, health, and education.”"	"News From Argentina; Round Ups Argentina; child labour; jujuy; Mauricio Macri; parque indoamericano; villa lugano"	"http://www.argentinaindependent.com/currentaffairs/newsfromargentina/argentina-news-roundup-28th-february-2014/"	"2014-02-28 22:15:45"	"2014-02-28 22:10:25"	"85"	"General"	"argentina independent"
"315219"	"Church and State in Argentina: The Long Road to Secularism"	"Celina Andreassi analysis the privileged status of the Catholic Church in Argentina and over a century of frustrated efforts to strengthen the secular state."	"Anyone walking around Plaza de Mayo one morning last March would have been surprised by the sight of the flag of a foreign state hanging from the side of the Buenos Aires City Government building. Foreign flags adorned the streets and children got a day off school to celebrate the appointment of the head of a theocratic country half way around the world. These were the first days of the pope-mania that swept the country. Blinded by the heady mix of patriotism and religious fervour that greeted the appointment of Jorge Bergoglio as head of the Catholic Church -and of the Vatican State- many seemed to forget that Argentina strongly proclaimed the division between Church and State well over 100 hundred years ago. Many examples in everyday life show that, despite Argentina being a mostly secular country, the Roman Catholic Church still enjoys a number of privileges that constitute an unfair discrimination against people of other or no religion. The Legal Status of the Church Vatican flag on the Buenos Aires City Government building (photo: Celina Andreassi) The Catholic Church has a preferential legal status that puts it above not only other religious institutions, but any other organisation of civil society. Article two of the 1853 Argentine Constitution proclaims that “The federal government supports the Roman catholic apostolic creed.” The ambiguity of the word ‘supports’ has spawned a debate over what the relationship between the government and the Church should be, and whether it can be considered that Catholicism is a state religion in Argentina. Lucas Arrimada, professor of Constitutional Law at the University of Buenos Aires, explains that: “The legal and constitutional doctrine reached a consensus long ago that the word ‘supports’ is to be understood as ‘economic support’ and not as the concession of a preferential, or official, status to the catholic creed or any other religion or creed.” A document by the Argentine Coalition for a Secular State (CAEL) points out that, despite the specific mentions to God and religion in the original constitution, the foundational years of the Argentine state were marked by a strong bias towards secularism. Between 1850 and 1920, many laws were passed that define the secular nature of the state, such as those that established free, mandatory, and secular public education, civil matrimony, civil registry, and the subordination of religious courts to civil courts, amongst others. The development of a secular state, however, was stalled after 1930. In the following decades, every military government to take power introduced measures that slowly eroded the secular trend and established long-lasting privileges for the Catholic Church. The democratic governments during this period managed to, at best, maintain the status quo, but did very little to reverse the conservative policies of the de facto governments, which ranged from the establishment of religious education in public schools, to privileged special relations with the Vatican. It is not surprising, then, that the legal development that cemented the privileged status of the Catholic Church occurred during a military government. In 1966, dictator Juan Carlos Onganía modified the civil code to award the Church its status as a ‘legal entity of a public nature’ -a status only enjoyed by the national, provincial, and municipal states. This means that the Church, unlike any other non-state institution, is governed by public, as opposed to private, law, and that, as a consequence enjoys a number of benefits, such as the guarantee that its properties cannot be seized. A Matter of Influence The pervasive presence of catholic rituals and symbols in public life are a constant reminder of the preferences awarded to the Church mainly during military governments, and which the democratic system has been unwilling or unable to abolish. Crucifixes in hospitals, courts, and other public buildings, statues of the Virgin Mary in the national and provincial congresses, as well as on roads and public parks, are just the visible and conspicuous face of more troubling trends. In the northern provinces of Tucumán and Salta, public school students receive religious education -Catholic education, more precisely. The Supreme Court of Salta even supported the constitutionality of this practice after it was challenged by the parents of non-Catholic students -overturning a first instance sentence- despite it contradicting international treaties on the matter. The case now rests with the Supreme Court in Buenos Aires -the one with the massive crucifix overlooking the judges’ bench. Argentina’s Supreme Court (photo: Gustavo Amarelle/ archivoTélam/lz) Education is one of the areas in which religious influence is most sensitive. In practical terms, this has meant, for example, that according to a report by CAEL, the Church “carries out an arbitrary, explicit, and systematic obstruction of the implementation of the national plan for sex education for children and youths contemplated in law 26,150 (…) in some provinces they have even confiscated textbooks in the name of Catholic morals.” In a country where 15% of babies are born to teenage mothers (with peaks of up to 25% in poorer provinces) the Church has lobbied strongly, and quite successfully, to have high school children not learn about contraception. What to do with unwanted pregnancies, then? The law has not offered a solution to this problem yet, as evidenced by the 500,000 (approximately) clandestine abortions per year. At least 100 (mainly poor) women die each year of complications brought about by clandestine abortions, though the actual number is thought to be considerably higher. Whilst Congress does not seem to be anywhere close to decriminalising abortion, religious interests have done quite well in blocking access to the few cases where the practice is already legal (rape or health risks to the mother). Despite the existence of a Supreme Court ruling from 2012 which sought to clarify the terms under which non-punishable abortion should be carried out, restrictive legislation continues to be in place in staunchly Catholic provinces, such as Salta. Even in provinces where this is not the case, relentless campaigns continue to re-victimise and humiliate women who seek legal abortions. In October 2012, a woman victim of trafficking networks who had fallen pregnant after being raped had to endure a traumatic ordeal after the Buenos Aires City government illegally released information about her case, prompting a Catholic ‘pro-life’ group to seek an injunction keeping her from having an abortion at a public hospital. The hospital’s chaplain (chaplaincies are another form of encroachment by the Catholic Church in public institutions such as hospitals and the Armed Forces) led the charge, going as far as holding mass in front of the woman’s house. Unlike Salta, the City of Buenos Aires does a have protocol to treat these cases in line with the Supreme Court ruling, despite the City government’s efforts to veto it. At What Cost? The costs of straying from the foundations of a secular state are not just social and symbolic: the Argentine state spends an undefined but significant amount of money in honouring article two of the Constitution. Rally in support of secular education. Buenos Aires, 1959 (photo: Wikipedia) Fernando Lozada, from CAEL, says it is hard to know exactly how much public money flows towards the Catholic Church. The budget for the Secretariat of Worship shows a spending of $40m in wages and pensions for the hierarchy of the Catholic Church, who earn 80% of a judge’s salary -a benefit awarded by the last military dictatorship. Catholic schools, in turn, receive a whooping $4.5bn in subsidies each year. This, explains Lozada, does not include the money the state fails to collect on taxes on income and assets, of which the Church and the clergy are exempt, or the donations given to Caritas, whose accounts are “inscrutable.” It also does not include the donations given by individual municipalities -in his hometown of Mar del Plata, this amounts to $400,000 per year- or the money spent in restoration of churches and other buildings considered monuments. Representing Who? Much of the power and influence flaunted by the Catholic Church comes from its claim that it represents the majority of Argentines. Indeed, Argentina has a strong Catholic majority, something that is not at all incompatible with the idea of a secular state. A survey conducted by Conicet researchers, led by sociologist Fortunato Mallimaci, in 2008 gives a good overview of the religious make up of the Argentine population. The survey shows that 76.5% of Argentines consider themselves Catholic, whilst 11.3% are ‘indifferent’ (this group includes atheists and agnostics), 9% evangelic, and 3.3% ascribe to other religions. The northern provinces have the highest rates of Catholicism, whilst the lowest rates can be found amongst young people and those with higher education. Despite these overwhelming numbers, over 75% of people “never” or “infrequently” go to church, and 61.1% claim to connect with good “personally”, rather than through an institution. Further, the survey shows that most Catholics in Argentina do not support the Church’s views on controversial issues such as abortion, sex education, contraception, and homosexuality. The same research group conducted a study amongst members of Congress in 2011, in which they analysed the influence of religious convictions in their votes. Whilst 60% of lawmakers are Catholic, the majority would vote or have voted against the official Catholic stance on issues such as gender identity, abortion, same-sex marriage, euthanasia, and medically-assisted reproduction. Despite this autonomy at the individual level, over 90% of legislators believe that, overall, religious convictions and the influence of the Church play an important role in their colleagues’ legislative activity (half of them think this is right, and half think it is wrong). The survey shows that lawmakers frequently meet with Catholic authorities -over half had met with a bishop and 45% with a priest in the year prior to the study- to discuss political and social issues. Buenos Aires Cathedral (photo by Alexis González Molina on Wikipedia) Democratic Actions Whilst there is much to be done to get back on the path towards a truly secular state, it is important to highlight that a number of laws passed in the last 30 years have directly challenged the authority of the Catholic Church and its alleged ‘moral leadership’. In 1987, then-president Raúl Alfonsín earned himself the scorn of the Church when he pushed the Absolute Divorce Law through Congress. More recently, the Equal Marriage and Gender Identity laws awarded the LGBT community a wide range of rights, despite the intense catholic lobby. In 1994, under the presidency of Muslim-turned-Catholic Carlos Menem, a constitutional reform did away with some of the most controversial references to Catholicism, namely the requirement for a president to be Catholic and to swear by God and the Bible upon taking office (a requirement that, inexplicably, is still present in the provincial constitution of Catamarca) and the mandate to promote the conversion of indigenous peoples to Catholicism. The reform, however, failed to abolish article two (about the economic support to the Church) and to remove two mentions of “God” in the preamble and the text of the Constitution. Despite some set backs, there seems to be a general trend towards secularisation, and the extent of the influence of the Catholic Church is ambiguous. CAEL – formed by people and instititions from different creeds/religions, as well as atheists- and other organisations such as the Association for Civil Rights (ADC) are carrying out a number of initiatives to move the secular cause forward. Campaign for apostasy (photo courtesy of Apostasía Colectiva on Facebook) Under the slogan ‘Not in my name’, the Collective Apostasy campaign was launched in 2009, encouraging people who had been baptised at birth but who do not agree with the preaching of the Catholic Church to have their names removed from the Church’s records, as guaranteed by the Personal Data Protection law. Despite the many obstacles put forward by the different parishes, the campaign is ongoing. CAEL has also introduced a bill in Congress which addresses many of the issues affecting the secularity of the state and has participated in the public audiences related to the reform of the civil code (their request to have article 33 -which grants the Church its status as a ‘public nature’ entity- amended has, however, fallen on deaf ears). There is also a petition underway to replace the public holiday of 8th December -which celebrates the ‘Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary’- with one on 10th December – International Human Rights Day-. The main concern for secularist groups, however, is the recent wave of Catholic fervour brought about by the papacy of Jorge Bergoglio. In Lozada’s words, “those of us who work for a secular state knew we were going to receive a new onslaught of clericalism in Latin America and in Argentina” when the appointment was announced. Rather than diminishing their efforts, this should serve as a reminder of the importance of establishing, once and for all, a fully secular state that guarantees true diversity and equality for all beliefs."

According to the plan, the company will be divided into six independent business units which will keep the conglomerate’s existing TV, cable TV, and radio licences. The media group will now have 30 days to inform whether it will divide these units amongst its shareholders or sell some of them, and 180 days to fully execute the divestment plan. “We are pleased to have got this result: that all media groups, even the most powerful and dangerous for democracy, have to abide by the law,” said head of AFSCA Martín Sabbatella. Another large media group, Grupo Uno, and other smaller groups also had their proposals approved today and will have to carry them out under similar terms. AFSCA is yet to approve the plans presented by Telefé-Telefónica, Telecentro, and Prisa-Radio Continental. Argentina to Lodge Final Appeal before US Supreme Court: With private negotiations still underway, the Argentine government will today file an appeal before the US Supreme Court on the case against the so-called ‘vulture funds’. This time, Argentina will be represented by former US Solicitor General Paul Clement, who will join the existing legal team. The country is appealing a sentence that orders the state to pay holdouts US$1.3bn, on the grounds that re-opening the debt swap -as the government has proposed- would satisfy the pari passu clause, according to which all bondholders must be treated equally, as demanded by the previous rulings. Whilst the government has expressed optimism regarding its chances, especially with the incorporation of Clement to the legal team, it continues to negotiate an out-of-court settlement with the holdouts. If the Supreme Court decides to review the case, it could take up to a year to reach a final verdict. If it rules against Argentina, the country would enter a ‘technical default’. Judges to be Tried for Crimes Against Humanity: A landmark human rights trial began today in Mendoza, where four judges are facing charges for their alleged complicity with crimes against humanity committed during the last military dictatorship. A total of 38 people are being prosecuted by the federal court in Mendoza, including judges Luis Miret and Otilio Romano. This ‘mega-trial’ brings together a dozen cases involving 207 victims of human rights abuses and is being conducted via video conference, since many of the accused are in different parts of the country, such as Tucumán, Buenos Aires, and Rosario. The importance of this trial, highlighted prosecutor Dante Vega, lies on the fact that it is starting to try the civilian component of the last dictatorship. “And this is so because it’s impossible to think about state terrorism without [taking into account] the role that the judiciary played. The hypothesis of the prosecution is the complicity of the judicial structure with state terrorism, and we’re going to try and prove this during the trial.” It is expected that 660 witnesses will be called to testify, and that the trial will last at least 18 months."

"Family and friends mourn victim of clashes between militias and army (photo: AFP/Alfredo Estrella/Télam/aa) Mexico – Michoacán Militias Agree to “Gradual Demobilisation”: The self-defence groups operating in the Mexican state of Michoacán have reached an agreeement with the federal government by which they will undertake a “gradual demobilisation”. Militia leaders have committed to staying away from urban areas and to doing a “clean-up” within their ranks. Estanislao Beltrán, a spokesman for the militias, confirmed that “we will do a clean-up of all those who are in the towns and who were part of the movement. Those who have problems, who have legal problems and those who are criminals, they will have to pay,” adding that “we don’t negotiate with criminals.” They will also remove barricades in areas “where they are not needed anymore” due to the presence of federal security forces. Militias were formed in Michoacán as a way to protect the population from the criminal activities of drug cartels. Earlier this year, the federal and local governments announced the implementation of a joint strategy to regain control of the state and take over security procedures. Costa Rica – Farmers Denounce Environmental Damage: The North Land and Freedom organisation, in northern Costa Rica, has denounced that the construction of a hydroelectric dam in the area is causing widespread environmental damage. The Bijagua hydroelectric project, carried out by cooperative Coopeguanacaste, is expected to have a capacity of 17.39 MW once completed. However, according to a statement by North Land and Freedom, “the cooperative has opened at least three different work sites and within a few days it has destroyed the protected areas of the Zapote and Bijagua rivers, despite the water law banning works in the banks of rivers and ravines.” The statement also accuses Coopeguanacuaste of removing vegetation in order to build a tunnel and other complementary works in the area. “Even though the environmental impact assessment for the Bijagua Hydroelectric Project was approved on 18th December 2012 (…) this cannot be a blank cheque for the Cooperative to destroy the ecosystems in the region.” North Land and Freedom brings together farmers’ organisations from Upala, Los Chiles, and Guatuso, as well as the Maléku indigenous community. Brazil – Court Recognises Rural Settlement: At least 78 families from the Osvaldo de Oliveira camp obtained their right to own land. This came after four evictions and three years of struggle at the settlement in Macaé, Rio de Janeiro. Last week, judge Eduardo Aidé Bueno de Camargo confirmed the beginning of the process to regularise the situation of the families. In September 2010 the zone had been declared an area of social interest through a decree signed by former president Lula Da Silva. Then, in 2012, the National Institute for Colonisation and Agrarian Reform determined the divestment of the lands. The families are part of the Landless Workers’ Movement (MST).

"Flooding in the City of Buenos Aires (photo: María Candelaria Lagos/Télam/lz) Hundreds of People Evacuated Due to Heavy Rain: At least 2,000 people had to be evacuated today as torrential rains hit the province of Buenos Aires. A woman died after being dragged by the water of a creek which had burst is banks in the Greater Buenos Aires district of Almirante Brown, where over 100 people were evacuated. A similar number of people had to be evacuated in Berisso, near La Plata, and around 60 in Luján due to flooding. The towns of San Nicolás, San Pedro, Arrecifes, and Ramallo are also amongst the worst affected, according to Infobae. In the capital, several neighbourhoods flooded, over 100 traffic lights stopped working, and subtes and trains suffered delays and service suspensions throughout the day. In the neighbourhood of Villa Lugano, a service station was struck by lightning, causing a small fire that was quickly put out by firefighters. Consumers Boycott Supermarkets in Protest at Price Hikes: Groups of consumers today took part in a collective boycott of supermarkets and petrol stations in protest at recent price hikes. The movement, named ’7F Apagon al consumo’ (consumer ‘black out’), was shared by thousands on Twitter and Facebook since being created last weekend, though there are no reliable measures of how many people took part today. The president of the Union of Consumers in Argentina, Fernando Blanco Muiño, today supported the measure, saying it was “educational” for consumers. “It is important to make consumers aware of they power they have to unite under a single banner and form a social front against the abuses of economic powers,” Muiño told Télam. In a separate measure, the director of the Federation of Chinese Supermarkets and Associations in Argentina, Miguel Angel Calvete, announced today that over 1,100 Chinese-owned supermarkets in Greater Buenos Aires and Rosario would boycott meat suppliers until next Tuesday to protest “excessive” price increases. Policemen Prosecuted Over Drug Trafficking Links: Eight policemen and an informant were prosecuted in Córdoba yesterday due to alleged links with drug trafficking organisations. They have been accused of seizing drug shipments from drug trafficking groups and handing them over to rival gangs. Two of the officers involved are the former heads of the Anti-Drug Trafficking Division of the Córdoba police between 2009 and 2013. The on-going investigation into the relationship between policemen and drug traffickers has already caused a former security minister and police chief to resign. Vice-President Boudou Submitted Statement Over Ciccone Case: Vice-President Amado Boudou appeared before a judge today over the Ciccone case. After prosecutor Jorge Di Lello requested Boudou be called in to declare yesterday, the vice-president decided to spontaneously appear before the judge and submit two statements detailing his position. In one of the statements, Boudou said that “the process of lifting Ciccone Calcográfica S.A.’s bankruptcy and the payment plan [awarded to it] was the product of a judicial decision, on one hand, and of the discretionary faculties of the head of [tax agency] AFIP.” According to his lawyer, Boudou “will face the court like any other citizen”, rather than requesting immunity due to his elected position. This morning, Chief of Cabinet Jorge Capitanich defended the vice-president and said he is being the victim of a “media lynching”."

"Salvador Sánchez Cerén, frontrunner in the El Salvadorian presidential elections (photo: wikipedia.org) El Salvador Presidential Elections go to Second Round: With nearly all the votes counted, results indicate yesterday’s presidential election in El Salvador will go to a run-off on 9th March. Current vice president Salvador Sánchez Cerén from the governing left-wing FMLN party received 48.9% of the votes, and will face conservative Norman Quijano from the Nationalist Republican Alliance, ARENA, who took 38.9% in the first round. The winner will take power on 1st June and will govern the country for the next five years. Both candidates accepted the results and announced their willingness to form alliances with other political parties. Sánchez Cerén has already reached out to the UNIDAD movement’s candidate, Elías Antonio Saca, to work together in the next government. Sunday’s election had a turnout of just 53%, according to the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, almost ten percentage points lower than the 2009 elections. Costa Rica Elections: Residents of Costa Rica also went to the polls yesterday to vote in the country’s general elections, choosing new representatives in congress, new governors, and a new president. With no outright winner, the two leading presidential candidates will face a run-off on 6th April. The governing Partido Liberación Nacional (PLN)’s candidate, Johnny Araya, who obtained 29.5% of the vote, will face Partido Acción Ciudadana (PAC)’s Luis Guillermo Solís, who obtained 31% of the vote. Neither candidate has so far spoken of potential alliances, but it seems likely the winner will have to form some kind of coalition to govern, as they will face a divided congress when they take power on 8th May. PLN received 18 of the 57 legislative seats, PAC took 13, with the remainder divided between five other parties. Honduras – Diplomatic Relations Re-established with Latin American countries: The governments of Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador officially recognised Juan Orlando Hernández’s government in Honduras at last week’s Celac summit in Cuba. Following this, the three countries announced at the weekend they would re-establish diplomatic ties with the Central American nation after almost five years, when a coup ousted democratically-elected Juan Manuel Zelaya, leading to a political crisis in the country, and a diplomatic crisis in the region. Cuba has Highest Literacy Rate in Latin America: According to a UNESCO report published on Saturday, Cuba has the highest literacy rate in Latin America. The annual report, entitled ‘Teaching and Learning: Achieving Quality for All‘, highlighted the Caribbean island’s achievements, noting that 13% of the country’s GDP goes towards education, compared to a regional average of 5.5%. The report looked at countries’ progress under the Education for All global commitment to provide basic education for all children, youth, and adults, as agreed at the World Education Forum in Dakar in 2000. At the forum, 164 governments pledged to work towards six goals to be met by 2015, and are working with development agencies, civil society, and the private sector to achieve the targets, under the coordination of UNESCO. In Latin America, around 10% of children of school age are not achieving basic standards in reading and writing, and 30% are lacking in mathematics. Standards varied widely by country, and within social groups within national borders, with the poorest often faring the worst. For example, in Haiti only 42% of young people from a poor background know how to read and write, compared to 92% of their better off compatriots. The report highlighted that if current trends continue, developing countries will not achieve their targets until 2072."

"Young men fight against the police in December 2001 (Photo: Sub Coop/Nicolas Pousthomis) Trial Begins Over December 2001 Deaths: The trial of 17 former civil servants and police officers for their role in the violent suppression of protests in Buenos Aires at the end of 2001 began today. Five people were killed and hundreds injured in the capital during clashes between protesters and police on 19th and 20th December 2001. Among those facing various charges that include manslaughter, causing injury, and abuse of authority, are ex security secretary Enrique Mathov, and former chief of police, Rubén Santos. Ex president Fernando De la Rúa, who fled from the Casa Rosada by helicopter on the evening of 20th December, has already been absolved of blame for the violence and is not among the accused. In total, 38 people were killed across the country in two days of violent protests at the height of Argentina’s economic crisis in 2001-2002, which culminated in a historic default and mega-devaluation a few days later. Social Groups Demand Release of Detainees in Chaco: The lawyer of five indigenous men who have been detained since last Thursday in Pampa de Indio, Chaco, said they were being held without the proper court order and issued a habeus corpus (writ) yesterday demanding their release. The five were arrested during violent clashes with police who came to remove indigenous groups that had blocked a provincial highway in protest at planned changes to food welfare programmes. “It’s noteworthy how they try to use judicial practices for local detainees that do not conform with national and international standards, especially when they are indigenous,” said lawyer Gonzalo García Veritá. However, Provincial Assistant Prosecutor General Hugo Miguel Fonteina said that the five men had not made a complaint about their arrest or treatment by police, and that all the correct procedures were being performed. Several social groups are planning a march in the city of Resistencia on Thursday to demand the release of the men and guarantees from the provincial government over its social programmes. Teachers Threaten Strikes If Salary Negotiations Fail: The national teachers’ union CTERA threatened to go on strike for 48 hours on 5th and 6th March if an agreement on wage increases is not reached with the government. The first round of negotiations ended on Friday without agreement, with CTERA leader Stella Maldonado announcing the potential for industrial action while waiting for another round of talks. “We are against the 22% increase the government proposed – this is a long way from the needs of the people,” said Maldonado, adding that the union was “mobilised and in a state of alert”. Teachers affiliated to various unions are asking for increases of between 42% and 66% on last year’s salaries. This morning, Cabinet Chief Jorge Capitanich reiterated that the national government only negotiates a starting salary, and that the final wage agreements would be made by authorities in each provincial jurisdiction. Capitanich added that the government would make a “unilateral proposal” if an agreement could not be reached."

"Juan Manuel Santos Colombian President (Photo: Facebook official account)Colombia – Spying Scandal Hits FARC Peace Talks: Revelations have emerged that military intelligence agents may have illegally tapped the phones of government negotiators engaged in peace talks with the guerrilla group FARC. Weekly magazine Semana yesterday published a report based on a 15-month investigation into the alleged spying, which it says began in September 2012, two months before peace negotiations began in Havana. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos today ordered a full investigation into the allegations, saying that “dark forces” were looking to sabotage the peace talks with FARC. “It is unacceptable from any point of view that this type of intelligence is undertaken against ordinary citizens, political opposition, and much less against state officials,” said Santos. Paraguay – Farmers Demand Investigation into Activist’s Murder: Members of the National Farming Federation (FNC) protested today outside the Ministry of Interior and Public Prosecutor’s Office to demand an investigation into the killing of farmer Nery Benítez in the San Pedro district on Sunday. Benítez was shot 12 times in the rural community of Luz Bella, in what the FNC says was payback for his participation in local protests against the chemical spraying of soy fields in the area. A day before his death, Benítez was part of a group of around 80 protesters that clashed with police over an operation to clear more land in the area to make way for soy cultivation. In a statement on its website today, the FNC said: “the murder has all the characteristics of a revenge attack, because Nery Benítez actively participated in the resistance and after the police repression was responsible for getting the injured to hospital.” Peru – Hundreds of Dead Dolphins Found: More than 400 dead dolphins were found washed up along Peru’s northern coastline in the month of January, compared to around 800 in the whole of 2012. Autopsies are being carried out to determine the cause of these mass deaths, though so far there are no conclusive answers. Early studies by the Peruvian Sea Institue (Imarpe) suggested that the animals were not poisoned by anything used by fishermen, though it is awaiting the results of further tests. Imarpe also noted that dolphins and other marine mammals are frequently drowned after getting caught in fishing nets. Animal conservation group Mundo Azul, meanwhile, says the practice of killing dolphins for human consumption or to use as bait to hunt sharks in Peru is a major problem, despite being outlawed since 1996. The group estimates that around 15,000 dolphins are killed in this manner in Peru every year."

Osvaldo Soto was buried today, as negotiations continued between the city government, law enforcement, and the occupiers. However, the talks have so far been fruitless, and the City Government’s Social Development Minister, Carolina Stanley, said that the government would not “negotiate with those who break the law”, and dismissed out of hand the possibility of economic assistance to those who had taken over the plot of land, which is close to Parque Indoamericano and next to Villa 20, in the south of the city. The settlers are demanding land to build property, claiming the city government has failed to deliver on promises of social housing. So far the government has refused to use force to evict the settlers, perhaps as a similiar stand-off in Parque Indoamericano, when 5,000 settlers occupied the park in December 2010, led to violent clashes in which three were killed. Negotiations are set to resume tomorrow. Despegar.com Offices Closed for Tax Evasion: The government has announced the closure of the offices of Despegar.com travel website for alleged tax evasion. The announcement comes after a raid on the offices by AFIP tax agency officials and police yesterday afternoon. According to AFIP the company is under investigation for not paying taxes on profits made and for using a group company with offices in the United States for various transactions, taking advantage of a tax loophole for foreign non-residents of Argentina. In a statement, head of AFIP Ricardo Echegaray said: “Countries who undertake activity in Argentina should know that they have to pay taxes in our country … We know that the G-20 are deciding what to do with large multinationals which hide their activities in off-shore companies, and we are taking concrete action against those who are dodging their taxes.” However, Despegar.com today won an injunction which will allow the website to continue to function from Argentina whilst the investigation continues, although all transactions must be done online, as the travel agency’s offices will remain closed. Russian Gay Couple Seek Refugee Status: A gay couple from Russia who got married in Buenos Aires today have officially asked for political refugee status, as they fear persecution if they return to their homeland. Alex and Dimitri, from Sochi, which recently hosted the Winter Olympics, left Russia as a result of the homophobic persecution which has become a policy of current president Vladimir Putin’s administration.

"Firefighter at the scene (photo: Daniel Dabove/Télam/lz) Nine Killed in Barracas Fire: Nine people have died as a result of a fire in the Buenos Aires neighbourhood of Barracas. The fire started this morning at around 8.15am in a storage facility owned by US company Iron Mountain, its causes are still unknown. As firefighters worked to control the fire, a brick wall collapsed, trapping them under the rubble. Seven firefighters and two members of Civil Defence died due to the wall collapse, and 12 people were hospitalised. Security Secretary Sergio Berni confirmed this afternoon that six out of the 12 have already left hospital, and the remaining six are out of danger. Iron Mountain released a statement confirming that “all Iron Mountain employees are safe and accounted for” and assured that “we will investigate the cause of the fire and work closely with local investigators, police and fire authorities to understand what happened. The building was equipped with both fire-detection as well as a sprinkler system.” Authorities confirmed that the fire has now been contained. Presidential Announcements: President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner announced yesterday an 11.31% increase in pensions and a 200% increase in the yearly school allowance. The increase brings the minimum pension to $2,757 and the maximum to $20,109, and the school allowance, which is paid at the beginning of every school year, to $510 per child. During the televised speech, the president also announced that the government will launch a new price agreement to cover school materials shortly. “We believe in the development of the economy through consumption and investment,” said President Fernández, as she criticised businessmen who “instead of taking their foreign currency earnings overseas” should “re-invest them in the country.” As wage negotiations approach, she also took aim at unionists, saying: ”When I see union leaders who, before speculative maneuvers, the only solution they offer is increasing salaries and nothing else, I think they don’t understand what’s going on and that some want to enter a situation where the only ones who will be worse off are going to be the workers.” Petrol Price Capped: Economy Minister Axel Kicillof announced this afternoon that the government has reached an agreement with oil companies in order to put a cap on petrol prices. Companies will only be allowed to put prices up by 6%. In this context, Shell, which had increase its prices by 12%, will have to bring them back down to last week’s levels, whilst the other companies included in the agreement -YPF, Oil, Axion (Esso), and Petrobras- will be able to increase them. Kicillof also informed that demand for petrol rose by 142% between 2003 and 2013, and by 9% in 2013 compared with the previous year."

"369203"	"BA Embraces the CrossFit Challenge"	"Chiara Gnoli puts her doubts and trepidation to one side and has a go at the Buenos Aires take on the exercise craze sweeping the world: CrossFit."	"You may have heard your friends or colleagues excitedly talking about a little thing called “CrossFit”. The exercise craze that’s been spreading like wild-fire all over the world has arrived with a bang in Buenos Aires. Crossfit gyms, or as they like to call them “boxes”, which are in actual fact large warehouses, are popping up all over Buenos Aires. Having spoken to friends about the workout, upon arrival at the gym in Palermo Hollywood, I was mainly feeling fear. CrossFit is a high intensity workout that promises to tackle every muscle in your body. The workouts change daily, meaning that no two classes are the same. Unlike many other exercise classes, in a CrossFit box there are no mirrors – the philosophy is that you leave your ego outside of the box and work your hardest to push your boundaries physically. A typical one-hour class will include elements of cardio, weight lifting, gymnastics, and core training. Crossfit military training (photo by Arctic Warrior, via flickr) If that doesn’t scare you enough, the description on the official website most certainly will: “CrossFit is the principal strength and conditioning programme for many police academies and tactical operations teams, military special operations units, champion martial artists, and hundred of other elite and professional athletes worldwide.” But, having decided that this year will be the year I finally get into tip top shape, I decided to face my fear and head on down to a box to give it a shot. The workouts are hard, but in actual fact, I found the entire experience exhilarating. It is not (just) an hour long sweat-fest: in reality, 45 minutes are spent perfecting various exercises like lunges, squats, burpees, and a combination of weight lifts with squats. We’ve all heard the phrase before – it’s not how many squats you do, it’s HOW you do them! It’s all about the technique: if you do it right, you’ll only need a few repetitions of the exercise in order to reap the benefits. This is where CrossFit wins as an all-round class that really helps you achieve results. The trainers focus on exactly this – making sure you are doing exercises correctly. While one instructor leads the class, another walks around and adjusts your posture and technique. CrossFit class at Tuluka (photo via CrossFit Tuluka Facebook page) After 45 minutes of this comes the hard bit. The last ten minutes focus on the notorious “workout of the day” (WOD) which each instructor will decide on at the beginning of the day. The day I attended, the WOD was a strenuous combination of ten burpees, 25 squats, 50 lunges, and 100 star jumps… TWICE! They put a ten minute timer on and you do as much as you can before the buzzer goes off. The point is to get a high impact training and to test your fitness level. The idea is that, as you keep attending CrossFit, you’ll see your ability to make progress on the WODs increase. Without those pesky wall-mirrors, you’re encouraged to concentrate on your ability to keep going rather than how you look. The attentive instructors encourage you and ensure you are sticking to the technique. They are the hardest ten minutes of the entire class, but you end up feeling invigorated and full of energy. Writing this in the days after the class, I have a seriously bad case of the aches in areas I didn’t even know existed. It was definitely worth it, however, and the prospect of actually doing exercise properly for once makes it all the more appealing. The CrossFit team are serious: before you attend, you must go through a health check to ensure you are able to take part in the class. Throughout the workout, you’ll feel as though you have your own personal trainer. CrossFit is really a mentality, and while I was sceptical at first thinking it was just a hipster fad, I quickly realised it lives up to the hype. It’s a serious workout that encourages participants to focus on technique and push their boundaries. Try it out for yourself! I tried a class with CrossFit Tuluka, an established group with various locations in Buenos Aires – to find the nearest box to you and information about prices, visit the website. There are other options in the city, including CrossFit Rex, with a box in Monserrat (near San Telmo), Kasten CrossFit (Palermo) or CrossFit Unidos, located in Villa Crespo."

"Minister Lino Barañao and Biochemist Gabriel Rabinovich (photo: Télam/jcp) Argentine Scientists Present Key Findings in Fight Against Cancer: A group of Argentine scientists led by Dr. Daniel Rabinovich presented a discovery that could become a step forward in the fight against cancer. The scientists, from the Institute of Biology and Experimental Medicine (Ibyme) at Conicet, had their findings published in leading molecular biology publication Cell. They were able to identify a mechanism that can be used to treat certain tumors that are resistant to conventional treatments. “This is a great celebration for us (…) since this work was completely financed by Argentine funds, there were no foreign agencies involved in financing,” said Rabinovich, talking at a press conference yesterday where the findings were presented. The $1.8m project follows a “national line of work (…) It is not simply adding to an already developed international investigation,” highlighted Science and Technology Minister Lino Barañao. Mendoza Farmers Denounce Intimidation: A group of families from the district of Lavalle, in Mendoza, have accused a former police superintendent of attempting to illegally evict them from their land. In a statement published on their website, the Landless Rural Workers’ Union of Cuyo (UST) have denounced that a former superintendent with the Mendoza police has been trying to evict a group of residents from their community land, claiming to work for a multinational company which would have purchased the land. However the purchase, according to UST, would be illegal. The statement indicates that the ex police officer “and his hitmen have repeatedly tried to bring in shacks, bulldozers [into the property] and to set up fences, with the aim of keeping the ancestral land of the peasant communities.” The UST claims this is being done in connivence with the local police and the prosecutor’s office, and that they went as far as shooting a 16-year old resident -who did not suffer any injuries- over the weekend. Argentina to Send Aid to Bolivia: The Argentine government, through its ambassador to Bolivia, offered to send the neighbouring country a team of humanitarian aid volunteers to help assist people affected by the recent flooding. “The White Helmets -as the aid agency is called- are preparing to come and stay in Bolivia” and contribute with local authorities to assist up to 50,000 families, said ambassador Ariel Basteiro. “We activated the administrative and operative channels [on Wednesday] so that the Argentine Air Force can transport the necessary materials to face an emergency of this kind,” he added. The Argentine embassy in Bolivia will organise a campaign to collect clothing, food, “and everything our fellow citizens who want to actively show solidarity with the Bolivian people can bring.” Heavy rains have caused floods in the Bolivian Amazon in recent weeks, killing over 50 people."

"Panama canal Gatun locks (photo: Wikipedia) Panama – Canal Expansion Halted: The Panama Canal expansion project was suspended today due to a financial conflict. The Panama Canal Authority (ACP) failed to reach an agreement with construction consortium GUPC over funding for the final stages of the project. As the ACP refused to pay cost overruns of $1.6bn, which it deemed “exorbitant and unjustified,” the consortium ordered its sub-contractors to abandon the work sites. Jorge Quijano, the Canal administrator, said they would not be “bribed” and added that “at this point, the project can still be saved and (finished by) 2015… they leave and we stay, the work is going to be completed, we must go on with or without them.” GUPC said that negotiations to finish the project broke down, and that this poses an “imminent risk” of dismissal for the 10,000 workers employed in the expansion of the canal. Colombia – Army Officers Fired Over Spying Scandal: The Army’s chief of intelligence and the director of the Technical Intelligence Centre were relieved of their duties after it became known that military intelligence agents may have illegally tapped the phones of government negotiators engaged in peace talks with the FARC. The decision was announced by Defence Minister Juan Carlos Pinzón, who also informed that the former intelligence officers will have to submit a report addressing the allegations before the end of the week, and that legal proceedings have begun, both by the Military Penal Justice and by the prosecutor’s office. In a press conference, FARC leaders said that “not only are they spying the government’s peace delegation, but especially the FARC peace delegation,” and accused former president Alvaro Uribe of being behind the espionage. “Do not forget that Alvaro Uribe is public enemy number one of peace in Colombia,” said FARC leader Iván Márquez. Mexico – Works Announced for Michoacán: President Enrique Peña Nieto announced yesterday a public works plan for the state of Michoacán, The state has been plagued by violence, after years of confrontations between drug trafficking cartels and civilian militias. The president considered the multimillion dollar plan as a necessary step to take after regaining control of the territory. The US$3.4bn investment will go towards education, health, roads, safety, and recreation projects, amongst others. Peña Nieto said that his government “will make an effort for this great state to resume its everyday activities in an orderly, calm, and safe fashion,” and added that “we will be here for as long as it takes.” The federal government sent in security forces to Michoacán last month, in a bid to curb the violence resulting from the conflict between drug cartels and militias."

We give you the best options to NOT drink wine in the city of Mendoza."	"Over the years, Mendoza’s cup has runneth over with wine bars, restaurants touting extravagant wine cellars, and caravans of tours through the various wine regions. But what about the other alcohols, that perhaps don’t originate on a grapevine? Where is a tourist visiting the city to turn if he or she does not want to end the night with teeth stained violet? Thankfully, there are lots of alternatives in downtown Mendoza – from cocktail bars to breweries – it’s simply a matter of knowing where to look. Cachitas Bar Choice of cocktails at Cachitas (photo courtesy of Cachitas Bar) Decorated as a 1950s style diner and complete with black and white checkerboard tiles, Cachitas offers a whimsical vibe and truly impeccable libations. This bar and restaurant began as a hole in the wall and in the past year has grown into the most popular cocktail bar on the prestigious Sarmiento street. Owned by Mendoza locals and operated by an eclectic mix of expats, the clientele is heavily English speaking. Seating indoors is quite limited, but tables and chairs spill out onto the front patio. The drinks menu is complete with all manner of international cocktails from the Raspberry mojito to the Singapore sling. Just reading the names is enjoyable: blood and sand, the journalist, income tax cocktail. But in the off chance that you can’t find what you’re looking for on the menu, the team of international barmen are more than happy to accommodate a unique request. Just smile & make it worth their while. As for the fare, it’s really the cocktails that earn Cachita’s local fame. However, if you’re starving, the house-made burgers and fries will both satiate your cravings and prepare you for round two of drinks. Av. Sarmiento 784, Mendoza. Tel: (0261) 15-576-2244 Antares Antares’ sampler plate (photo: Madeline Blasberg) This national brewery chain, based in Mar del Plata, is one of the few places where it’s possible to order an artisan pint of something truly delicious. Antares offers ten styles of beer, as well as a rotating seasonal specialty known as the Brew Master’s selection, which ranges from a golden summer brew to green beer for St. Patty’s day. What to order: If you’re a seasoned beer drinker, dive into a pint of your favorite style. But if not, order the sampler plate: a small glass of four beers of your choosing, accompanied by tasting notes – a veritable cheat sheet for learning about the anti-wine. In case you’re not a beer-lover either, Antares also offers a basic assortment of traditional cocktails. Antares is open every day of the week, but it’s best to stop by between 7-8pm and enjoy their daily 2×1 happy hour on beer. Arístides Villanueva 153, Mendoza.

Two parts bar, one part restaurant, pH provides an ample selection of food & drink at reasonable prices. The barmen are trained in international cocktails and specialise in the more tropical variety of night-time drinks: caipirinhas, daiquiris, five flavors of mojitos, and many more. Though the ample cocktail menu and bar may cause more than a moment of indecision, most people go straight for the house specialty: the super mojito – a giant sized cocktail that’s big enough to share, but too delicious to let go of. Sit outside and enjoy watching Mendoza’s nightlife on parade, or enjoy a more intimate table indoors. Arístides Villanueva 282, Mendoza. Tel: (0261) 425-4272 Tempting, huh?

Indoor décor rings in your ear with primary colors, but outdoor patio seating overlooks the thoroughfare of Mendoza’s most popular streets. Inside, the bar is extensive and features some of the most premium and exotic liquors in Mendoza. Though the classics – mojitos, caiparinhas, fernet and coke – are all present, you hardly notice them beneath the long list of peculiar creations. Highlights include the clericó rosado (rosé wine, passion fruit, orange juice, and pink grapefruit syrup), the mojito burrito (made from burro – a local herb – instead of mint), or the Andes Michelada (Andes beer, lime juice, cilantro syrup and salt). Arístides Villanueva 257, Mendoza. Bute Located on the northwest corner of Plaza Independencia, half a block from the Park Hyatt, is a classically decorated restaurant and bar, Bute. The doors of Bute are almost always open, from 7am into the wee small hours of the night. Traffic through this corner restaurant begins with breakfast and ends with a glass of something strong. The bar is set up as an island in the middle of the dining room, and is an elegant place to sit for a while and sip on something delicious. But if that’s not what you’re in the mood for, the outdoor seating overlooks the city’s main plaza. Photo courtesy of Bute Though the cocktail menu of Bute doesn’t offer any truly exotic concoctions, it does sweet justice to both local and international classics: the gin & tonic, bloody Mary, and sex on the beach, for example. The house’s signature drink, Bute, is also one to keep in mind, made from Amarula, Cointreau, white chocolate ice cream, sugar, and black pepper. Breaking with some of the less agreeable cultural norms, the service in Bute is excellent. Wait staff is friendly and efficient. They even occasionally feature local jazz bands on weekday nights.

"Randazzo and Capitanich show the new train (photo: Interior and Transport Ministry) First New Train Arrives in the Country: Interior and Transport Minister Florencio Randazzo and Chief of Cabinet Jorge Capitanich introduced today the first train of the new fleet that will replace the existing ones on the Sarmiento line. The train arrived at the Buenos Aires port from China, and it is the first of 25 that have been purchased and are expected to arrive in the country within 90 days. Randazzo highlighted that the new trains have improved security systems, German brakes, and an automatic stop system. He also promised that “we will replace the 11 existing trains [in the Sarmiento line] for the 25 new ones” by mid-June, “and by the end of the year the new trains for the San Martín and Mitre lines will also be ready.” Inmates Escape Maximum Security Prison: Six men escaped a maximum security prison in the Buenos Aires town of Junín in the early hours of the morning.  Police sources informed that the inmates managed to escape the prison at around 4am by cutting two wire perimeter fences. Their absence was noticed this morning as prison authorities did the daily head count. Local police have begun search operations around the area. The last few months have seen growing concern surrounding the large number of prison escapes in Argentina. Assistant Secretary of Criminal Policy and Penitentiary Affairs, Martín Daniel Martínez, stated last year that “escapes from national prisons are always down to human error,” whether it be through connivance or malpractice of the employees working in the system. Water Emergency Declared in Caleta Olivia: The Santa Cruz provincial congress has declared a ‘water emergency’ in the city of Caleta Olivia, which has seen its water supply affected due to a broken water pipeline. Residents have blocked national route number 3 in protest for the last week, and in last night’s assembly they decided to carry on with the road block as they feel their demands have not been met. Problems began when the pipeline that brings water from neighbouring Chubut province broke in early February, and the town was without water for almost three weeks. At the moment, only around 40% of the town has water supply, but at a very low pressure. Due to the water problems, banks, schools, and many shops are not working, whilst the local hospital is providing a basic service."

"The scene after the assassination of Martín Luis Paz (photo: José Granata/Télam/ef) Drug Gang Leaders and Policemen Prosecuted: A court in Rosario prosecuted 35 people allegedly involved in drug trafficking operations in the province of Santa Fe, including 14 members of the security forces. The accused were charged with conspiracy to commit a crime, and include members of the ‘Los Monos’ drug cartel -some of them members of the Cantero family- as well as 12 Santa Fe police officers, one federal police officer, and one coast guard officer. The 500-page ruling released today comes after an 18-month long investigation into the murder of Martín ‘Fantasma’ Paz, believed to have been killed by members of Los Monos, which has also exposed alleged links between drug traffickers and police officers. Carlos Varela, defence attorney for various members of the Cantero family, said that they will appeal the prosecutions. New Centre for Victims of Trafficking in Tucumán: The Defence Ministry will transfer the building of a former military hospital in Tucumán to the María de los Angeles Foundation, which will set up a care centre for children of victims of people trafficking or gender violence. The agreement was reached yesterday between Defence Minister Agustín Rossi and the head of the Foundation, Susana Trimarco, during a meeting. A statement by the Defence Ministry indicates that, during the meeting, Trimarco “explained the need to create a space to contain and care for the children of survivors of people trafficking, of women who are subject to prostitution, or who have been victims of any gender violence related crime.” In response, Minister Rossi “committed to carrying out the necessary procedures for the ex Military Hospital in Tucumán to be refit in order to house a new assistance centre by the María de los Angeles Foundation.” The contract, which will stipulate the conditions of the loan for use, will be signed within 20 days. Government Calls Teachers to Negotiate Wages: Chief of Cabinet Jorge Capitanich announced today that collective wage negotiations for teachers will begin on Friday 21st February. Capitanich highlighted that “the national state is not an employer, therefore it established the beginning of wage negotiations to set the initial wage for the 2014 school year.” In effect, the national negotiation will establish a minimum that will have to be respected in future provincial wage negotiations. Sergio Romero, spokesman for the Argentine Teachers’ Union, told Infobae that he hopes to achieve a positive result from the negotiations with the government, but warned that the union is willing to execute an “action plan”, which would include strikes, if they cannot reach an agreement. According to Romero, “no teacher should earn less than $5,500 per month.”"	"Current Affairs; News From Argentina; Round Ups Argentina; Drug trafficking; los monos; maria de los angeles foundation; people trafficking; Rosario; Susana Trimarco; teachers; wage negotiations"	"http://www.argentinaindependent.com/currentaffairs/argentina-news-roundup-19th-february-2014/"	"2014-02-19 22:59:56"	"2014-02-19 22:20:40"	"85"	"General"	"argentina independent"

"540088"	"The Triple Enigma"	"Translated into English by The Indy, an investigation by Revista MU into three shocking crimes in Trelew, connected by alleged police brutality and a judicial cover up."	"This article was originally published in Revista MU in July 2013. Three linked cases? A minor violated in a police station, the assassination of a protected witness, and the disappearance and death of a 13-year-old boy. Institutional violence in Chubut and its concealment. The groups that won’t give up, and the families that overcome fear. Protests against impunity in Trelew (photo: César Monsalvez/Revista Mu) In a bar in Trelew there is a television screen stuck on a Buenos Aires news channel. The channel is showing the Angeles Case, the crime, the caretaker, the families, the panelists, the experts. Empty words serve to fill the time. The volume is set at zero: I don’t know whether to thank God, or the waiter. You can see the capital’s temperature, the potholes, and celebrities, things that are more relevant to the so-called “national” media than the conversation that I am holding in this bar. I’m told about three linked stories. Three “cases”, as people and crimes are called in legal and journalistic jargon. Any scientist, news producer, or television detective would celebrate the discovery of what can be presented as cases A, B, and C: Case A: A 16-year-old, illegally arrested, tortured, and violated by eight police officers in Chubut, in Trelew’s 2nd Police Station on 18th January 2012. I reiterate, a boy of 16. Case B: Bruno Rodríguez Monsalve, 22, detained in the same police station and witness to Case A. He decided to report the incident. His initial statement was taken in an interrogation room. The provincial authorities considered him a protected witness, to protect him from the police. He was stabbed and killed on 26th March 2012. I reiterate, a young man of 22. Case C: César Monsalve, 13, nephew of Bruno (Case B), disappeared 27th May 2013. The family, the lawyer, and the Criminal Court suspect that it could be considered a kidnapping committed by the police, and linked to cases A and B. But the public prosecutor, Fabian Moyano, decided that the case was just of a missing person, and it was left in the hands of the same police. The body was found on 8th July, four days after the case was reported to the International Human Rights Commission. The age of César at the time of his disappearance: 13. One rape victim, one murder, and one missing person found dead a month and a half later. Two of them were minors. And as befits any trilogy, there is a fourth component, inevitably, in Trelew: the fatal beating of Julián Antillanca* and the movement generated by his father César, a builder, in the search for justice. The link that unites all of these stories could be the police as responsible, complicit, or suspect, depending on how you look at it. The judiciary often works to compulsively absolve, except for certain exceptions. Now, everything is in the hands of the families, friends, lawyers, and local residents, who are not resigning themselves to impunity. Case A: The Genesis of Evil In the bar, Fernando Almonacid and Estela Alvarez, the parents of the boy from Case A, are heartbroken. He is a maintenance worker in a health insurance company, she is a school caretaker. Fernando looks at me puzzled: “I have the privilege of having my son alive.” Estela wipes her wet cheeks with her hand: “He has attempted suicide three times. But we tell him that he has a future ahead of him. They kill and disappear kids. What is this?” I do not know what this is: there are types of evil that do not have a definition. It is still not very clear which channel the rest of Trelew is watching. I shift my eyes from Fernando and Estela’s outrage: on the screen they stop showing the Angeles case and announce a debate about the primaries with candidates who are smiling and already made-up. The adverts come on. The Capture Fernando Almonacid and Estela Alvarez, parents of the 16-year old boy allegedly tortured by the police (photo: Revista Mu) The kids were returning from a dance. The teenager, his girlfriend, and a couple of friends. It was 18th January 2012. The boy was working with his father, helping him with his maintenance work. He didn’t have any criminal background or previous problems with the police, and they even filmed their journey home on their mobile phones, running, joking, and messing around: 16 year olds. On the way, there was an incident with a driver of a van that almost ran them over. When they arrived at the boy’s house, in the neighbourhood of Presidente Perón, the police cars appeared; they jumped on him and dragged him from the fence he was clinging to, screaming for his mother. Estela: “It was before 7am, it is a neighbourhood of working people, like us. Fernando had already left because he starts work at 7am. I take sleeping pills and so I didn’t hear.” The screams brought out the neighbours. The policemen beat him enthusiastically. The neighbours asked them to bring the owner of the van, that he was the one that had charged at them. They asked them to stop hitting the boy, that this was his house, and that his parents were inside. It was all pointless: they lifted him into the police van, which in itself was illegal and unjustified, though part of institutional violence consists of words which have no meaning. Estela speaks with an air of despair: “A neighbour woke me up and said ‘they beat your son terribly, they’ve gone to the police station’. As we are only five blocks from the station, I arrived in five minutes. Imagine this: they said that my son had thrown a stone at the police car, another said that he was hitting his girlfriend, and another that they were responding to a call. All lies, as was seen later in the trial. They even arrested his girlfriend for the scene she caused trying to stop them from taking him away. They held her and then afterwards left her with me, but I was anxiously waiting with my other son and daughter-in-law. That would have been at around 7.05am (7.08am, according to the file) until around 8.15am (8.10am), when they returned my son to me, beaten and wet.” She falls silent, to breathe, and to cry. Hell The boy was held in the 2nd Police Station the entire time, as was verified during the trial held in March last year; this in itself is an aberration, while his family were in the waiting room demanding he be released. He was “housed” in a corridor between the cells and the staff quarters, where they continued to beat him intermittently, until one of the policemen lifted him up and took him to the cells. They put the boy up against a wall, dropped his trousers and underpants, and they inserted a baton into his anus repeatedly as he screamed out in pain and the policemen cheered. Then they took him to the corridor, left him lying on the floor and threw a bucket of water on him. In a cell, witnessing the police brutality and hearing their screams, was Bruno Rodriguez Monsalve. How to Cover Up Fernando, the father of the raped boy: “His girlfriend and the other witnesses saw how they took him from the cell with his trousers down. It looked like he had fainted from the pain, and they threw water on him to remove any traces.” Estela, the mother: “They returned him to me that way, beaten, wet, dazed. We went to the Zonal Hospital, but it was only that night that he told me everything else that they had done to him. We went out and reported what had happened.” To calm the public scandal that resulted from the family’s complaint, Governor Martin Buzzi ordered the resignation of both the Chubut chief of police, Nestor Siri, and the commissioner of Trelew, Juan Carlos Contreras (who also suppressed a protest of 200 laid-off truck drivers that day), after “evaluating the series of acts of police violence that occurred, which will be investigated fully, to clearly determine all the motives and those responsible,” he said. Fernando: “For me, it was all political. They got rid of one and replaced him with another, they rearranged things, and they are still covering everything up.” A Living Victim Seventy rounds of identification to root out the defendants. There were forensics, testimonies, “advanced jurisdictional evidence”, like the statement of Bruno Rodríguez Monsalve (Case B), and even confessions from three of the eight defendants. Policemen Mario Bevaqua and Fernando Carballo, and doctor Fernando Zaghis pleaded guilty in exchange for lesser penalties (three years suspended sentence, and disqualified for six years from holding public office). And one more piece of evidence: contrary to what is the norm in Chubut, in this case the victim remained alive, and could recognise the police and say what happened. Embarrassment The trial was started in March last year. The defendants: Carlos Pato, Sergio Castillo, Hugo Ortiz, Aníbal Muñoz, and Carlos Treguil. The charges: unlawful imprisonment, harassment, torture, and serious sexual assault of a 16-year-old minor. Judges Ivana González, Adrián Barrios, and Darío Anguiano decided to hold the trial behind closed doors, using the excuse of “sparing the victim”, with the effect in practice of isolating the hearing, far from the scrutiny of society. Having the victim give his statement behind closed doors should have been sufficient. The court eventually acquitted the five defendants, who came out celebrating and remained in their positions, and who have taken it upon themselves to pass through the neighbourhood to mock the residents and the relatives. The biggest mockery was the ruling itself. One of the judges said that he was certain about the existence of sexual abuse, but the other two said no, as the records of the anal injuries indicated that they occurred on that day, but did not specify at what time (implying that the youngster could have been molested before arriving at the police station). Prosecutors Maria Tolomei and Arnaldo Maza, in calling for a mistrial, challenge the decision, highlighting that they saw the video recordings of the kids leaving the party, playing, laughing, running, something that would be impossible for someone abused in that way. The judges also omitted the statement of the medical examiner, Dr. Stella Maris Manzano, who described the injuries committed as repeated, non-consensual violence, and only possible with an object compatible with a baton. What they Rape you With A more perverse detail. The victim had stated: “…They started with a baton, (…) it was the big guy, I remember that well because it was him that caused it all, that had the idea (…). I suppose that it was a baton. I closed my eyes and I remember that I told God that I wanted justice and that I was leaving it in his hands. It burned, it hurt… please don’t speak to me about that anymore…” What is the conclusion of the judges about his statement? It is impossible to be sure that the sexual abuse was with a baton because the teenager could not accurately describe it. All readers are requested to photograph the item used the next time they are attacked, raped or killed by the police, to avoid inaccuracies. Thus, a trial unusually full of testimonies, acknowledgments, forensic evidence, and guilty confessions, gives a full acquittal to the five responsible. To add to the disgrace, Javier Tourniñán, a government minister, rallied against the prosecutors: “There was a lack of impetus in trying to get the evidence to back up the accusations,” he said, absolving the judges. That day, Trelew’s Commission Against Impunity and For Justice was born, which unites unions, human rights movements, and all types of organisations from political movements to university councils. Natalí Narváez, from the Commission: “With this ruling, they raped us all.” That was 26th April [2013]. A mistrial was requested, as a key witness could not be present: Bruno Rodríguez Monsalve, Case B. Case B: A Protected Dead Man Let’s return to an image: while the teenager was tortured and humiliated, in one of the neighbouring cells was Bruno Rodríguez Monsalve, watching and listening. He was 22 years old, and lived with his mother Marta and three nephews in a western neighbourhood in Trelew. As so often in many neighbourhoods (as with the case of the disappearance of Iván Torres) Bruno had had some run-ins with the police, and every so often would be held in custody at the station. What he saw and heard on 18th January 2012 made him decide to testify. A missing poster for Iván Torres, last seen at Comodoro Rivadavia police station, also in Chubut province, in 2003. Marta, who works with the elderly in the neighbourhood: “The following day he was hit by a police motorbike. They broke his knee, and they threatened him.” Bruno appeared before the public defender, Sergio Rey: “Man, they rode the bike on top of me. I want to get out of here, they’re going to kill me.” Estela, the mother of the teenager from Case A: “For us Bruno was like an angel sent by God, to say what he knew.” It was decided to take an early statement in an interrogation room, not because of paranoia but because of common sense. Bruno recognised two of the policemen without doubting, and lined up a third. The province considered him a protected witness and moved him to Santa Cruz, to some relatives’ home. Marta: “They gave him money and promised him that they were going to get him some work.” When the money ran out, Bruno returned to Trelew to process his documents, which he was required to do to get work in Santa Cruz. But the “protection” given to witnesses is not what you see in Hollywood movies. Bruno was moving alone. Three Stab Wounds A few days after Bruno returned to Trelew, on 26th March 2012, Marta heard him arrive home at 5am. “He said: ‘Mum’, he leaned against the table, and he fell. I thought that he had fainted because of a heart problem that he had. I opened his jacket, I lifted his sweater, and then I saw the stab wounds.” Hearing the cries of his mother, neighbours called for an ambulance, but the police arrived instead and Bruno died shortly afterwards. Three knife wounds. Marta: “The doctor said that he had lost a lot of blood, but the clothes were not stained, only the wounds were visible. I never understood. Shortly after Marta was persecuted and threatened by a police car. “They also laughed at me and drove the car at me. The prosecutor himself, Arnaldo Maza, came here to take our complaint, and he saw how a police car had stopped in front of the house, watching us, to frighten us. When they saw the prosecutor, they left in a hurry.” The murder of Bruno eliminated the main witness of the trial for Case A, which had led to the removal of the police chiefs. However, the possible participation of – or instigation by – the police was never investigated. And at the speed of a tweet, prosecutor Fabián Moyano had the crime solved thanks to the timely appearance of an “informer” related – obviously – to the police: Bruno had been murdered by a neighbour, in a settling of scores. Cintia Monsalve, Bruno’s sister, gives her account: “We knew that it was a lie. The guy that they accused, Gastón Béjar, was our friend. They were accusing anyone. A ‘scapegoat’, as they say.” Béjar, unexpectedly, was defended by two of the most expensive lawyers in Chubut, Gabalachis Fabián and Gustavo Latorre, normally defenders of police personnel (the Antillanca case, for example) and of the military and police on trial for the Trelew Massacre. Both were seen smiling while accompanying the policemen acquitted in Case A. The defendant Béjar also ended up being acquitted. According to Gastón Perez Alvarez, from the Commission Against Impunity: “The defendant was acquitted and, incidentally, they suspiciously resolved other charges that he had against him. One knows that the police outsource thefts and crimes, in exchange for protection. They were unable to prove it in this case, and now the crime against Bruno remains unpunished.” Case C: 13 Years On 27th May 2012 at 10am, César Monsalve, 13, nephew of Bruno (Case B), son of Cintia, and grandson of Marta, left his grandmother’s house to go see his aunt in the Inta neighbourhood. He was wearing shorts, a brown shirt, and only took his bus card. Not what you would expect from a runaway teen. The only timely coincidences: One month earlier, the defendants from Case A, the abuse at the police station, had been acquitted and released. And a few days later, the trial for Case B, the murder of his uncle Bruno, the ‘protected’ witness who was stabbed, would begin. Cintia Monsalve is 29 years old: ”My son always lived with my mum and my siblings. I had him when I was very young. When he didn’t appear, all of my family and friends started to look for him. On the 29th May I reported his disappearance. The police didn’t pay any attention, which I already knew would happen, because of my brother Bruno. They did not care about us. Quite the opposite. I could see that they are not doing anything. I said to a prosecutor: ‘must I wait until I get César back in a coffin? We’re not even speaking about an adult. He’s a baby.’ He told me that we must have faith.” Marta looks at me: “I don’t want to mix things. My son Bruno, they killed him and nobody is going to bring him back to me. But my grandson is a little boy, I want him to be at home…” She cannot finish. Cintia drinks mate. The cold wind can be heard against the door. Forced Disappearance In her first motions to file a complaint, alongside the Commission Against Impunity and the parents of Case A’s victim (who were getting over the acquittal of those responsible for the abuse of their son), Cintia met César Antillanca, the father of murdered Julián, and the lawyer Verónica Heredia. Together they filed a habeas corpus on 2nd June, stating that César Monsalve’s case is that of a forced disappearance: not someone that has escaped or is lost, but who has possibly been deprived of his liberty by state personnel. For this reason, they requested the withdrawal of the provincial police from the search, and of the judges from Case A. Judge Ana Servent ordered that the gendarmerie search police stations, hospitals, and emergency rooms. César was not found, and the habeas corpus was rejected. The Criminal Court made it clear that the child was still missing, and ordered the case be reopened. It also postulated a link between the disappearance of the child and the violent death of a protected witness as part of an investigation into institutional violence attributed to local police authorities. The conclusion: “From a legal point of view it would, the situation is that of a forced disappearance and not simply a missing person inquiry.” Chubut province, in the south of Argentina Crime Map Hours passed, days passed, César did not appear. Why think of institutional violence? Some information: forced disappearance was classified as a specific type of crime in Argentina in 2011, as one of the consequences that the State suffered from the conviction by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, after the disappearance of Iván Torres, in 2003, in the same province, Chubut. The lawyer then was the same as now: Verónica Heredia. In the last ten years, she has counted eight forced disappearances in the province. Her conclusion: “Until proven otherwise, all are forced disappearances.” Additionally, in Chubut, the Public Defence Ministry had to create a data bank on torture. In the last five years there has been on average 490 complaints per year registered against the so-called law enforcement. That is an average of between nine and ten cases per week. How many do not dare to come forward is unknown. The Pro Children’s Rights Group produced another report. It is a frightening read. Two examples, of hundreds: Eduardo Mariano Haro, testicles amputated in the 2nd Police Station of Comodoro Rivadavia, 17th November 2003. Gustavo Andrés Sáena, 24, “police beating, tore out his left eye”, 16th September 2011. It is commonplace to say that there are good cops and bad cops everywhere, like in Chubut. That may be true, but it doesn’t take into account structural issues that explain why the bad guys are so successful. A Chat with a Public Prosecutor Cases B and C have another thing in common: public prosecutor Fabián Moyano. He received the complaint over the disappearance of César on a Thursday, and told the mother that he needed to review the file. The following day we tried to contact the prosecutor, who was still reading the file. He agreed to meet us that evening. Eyes wide open, coughing, gazing at a paper, here are fragments of the dialogue: - A disappearance is not a crime in itself. - If it is a forced disappearance, it is. - But this is different. A boy left his house and we do not know where he went. I sent an official letter to La Rioja where he has relatives. Searches were made, all of the police personnel searched the river. - But if it is a forced disappearance, the police should be investigated, not be part of the investigation. - I do not have the slightest indication of that being the case. - How will you have such an indication if you don’t investigate? First you investigate, and then you can dismiss. - There is no indication. - There is: the complaint of the family, the filing of an habeas corpus, the ratification of the Criminal Court, the public’s own suspicions, the province’s background, such as the case of Iván Torres, which was condemned as a forced disappearance by the Argentine State. - It is a blemish that stigmatised us all. But if there is an habeas corpus with which the judge removes the police, and I am investigating with the police, we are covering all possibilities. I am in permanent contact with the judge, and we are exchanging information. I have 25 years of experience, and I would never cover for somebody, if I had the slightest suspicion, I would remove the police [from the case]. - Why rule out the hypothesis? - I’m not ruling it out. But if the suspicion is that there is a connection to the death of the protected witness Bruno Rodriguez Monsalve, nobody is in a better position than me to know that he was not killed by the police. In the trial I proved, through witness testimonies and wiretaps, that the person responsible for the death of Bruno was Gastón Béjar, in a settling of scores when they were both totally drunk and drugged, and Bruno had stolen a computer. - However, the court acquitted Béjar. So you didn’t prove that. - They turned the witnesses. These things happen. It is our system. But the police did not kill him. - Neither did they in the other cases of witness deaths, they send the guys who later gain material or legal benefit. Why discard this hypothesis? - Because I have another, and they are not compatible. These were the two conversations, one in person and another over the phone, in which the prosecutor said César was an out-of-control boy, like his grandmother, and blamed his mother for not reporting his disappearance sooner, and Bruno for travelling back to Trelew, all the while praising the role of the police. Investigating the State Why could César Monsalve have been disappeared? A mystery. But his disappearance, like the murder of his uncle Bruno, immediately heightened the general fear of testifying, which consolidates the absolute control of the police over any investigation. What if the prosecutor was right and there is another hypothesis? Lawyer Verónica Heredia: “When you suspect that somebody was forcibly disappeared, all logic is reversed. We must look at the State, not at the street. The State must demonstrate that it is not responsible. It is almost absurd to think that in a place like Trelew a boy leaves without anybody seeing him. Forced disappearance as part of the institutional violence in Chubut is based on a systematic practice of the police, mainly targeting poor boys in peripheral neighbourhoods, with complicity from the political powers and the silence of the judiciary, like Sofía Tiscornia described in her report to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.” What did anthropologist Sofía Tiscornia describe in this report about Chubut? Quote: “It is a unique phenomenon: legislation and law enforcement practices that violate human rights, and courts that – removed from the social conflicts of those most in need – do not investigate or are complicit in the crimes.” The Body Appeared On Monday 8th July, at 7pm, two boys were in a field with their father hunting hares with slingshots, and they found an unrecognisable corpse. The location is very close to the aerodrome and less than 300 metres from the Memorial Museum for the Trelew Massacre. It is also a kilometre and a half away from César’s house. The police said that the body was the size of César, with his clothes and his ID. The area by the Memorial Museum where César’s body was found (photo: Sanra Ritten) Prosecutor Moyano told MU, hours later: “The body doesn’t have organs, taken by scavenging animals, nor hands, nor nails. There is a hole in the chest area, and it will have to be determined it is was either a bullet, a knife, or something caused by an animal. The skull does not seem to be beaten. There are no signs that the body was dragged. The cause of death is not known, neither is whether he died and remained there, or if a murder occurred elsewhere and the body was moved there. I don’t know when, it could be that it has been there for some ten days. The police say that they hadn’t searched the area.” Natalí Narváez, from the Commission Against Impunity: “For us, they are all messages. The broken body that suddenly appears near the Memorial Museum, like saying: we will break all human rights. And the police now say that they didn’t search in one of the most obvious places: either they looked badly, or they didn’t want to look. It is all a joke. That body couldn’t have been there for one and a half months. They put it there now, because a complaint was filed before the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights and they didn’t want to have another Iván Torres in the province. Five days ago the people at the ‘Chubut’ newspaper started circulating rumours that the body could appear. For us, it is a forced disappearance followed by death, which can only have been caused by the police, to leave a message that they do what they want.” Verónica Heredia, lawyer: “I believe that the body, if it is confirmed to be César, appeared as a consequence of the complaints, the protests, and the recent media pressure. Otherwise, it would have never been found. I told prosecutor Moyano a while ago that leaving the investigation in the hands of the police would allow them to clear the evidence. He responded by saying that he is only investigating an inquiry as to the boy’s whereabouts. I also demanded he inspect all of Trelew’s police cars to confirm if the body was there. The prosecutor also refused. Now we are going to report the crime of forced disappearance followed by death in the Federal Courts, asking them to investigate not only the police, but the prosecutor himself.” Where is Justice? César Antillanca’s demand for justice after the crime committed against his son Julián, in Trelew, began with its own abuse: the ruling that acquitted the policemen involved despite the body of evidence. However, Antillanca, refusing to accept this, continued to mobilise the community, and the judicial appeal caused Chubut’s Supreme Court to annul the ruling and demand a retrial. The Supreme Court is also in crisis, with in-fighting and complaints amongst its members. “Maybe that’s why they are worried about regaining credibility, with rulings like that annulment,” suggests Heredia. It is all a symptom: to gain credibility, you have to have justice. Antillanca understands things better than many experts. He argues that we must create a truly independent Judicial Police, which prove to be reliable and have the powers to investigate the police. “The daily struggle is collective, and doesn’t have anything to do with hope and faith, but with confidence in all the work that is done, even with all of the difficulties involved in accepting that the official informer is the criminal. And the judiciary depends exclusively on the police. That’s why we have to create other institutions to bring justice and to put an end to the impunity.” Fernando and Estela, the parents of the raped boy: “The annulment of the Antillanca trial gives us hope that the same will be done in our case. But his son is dead. We have the privilege of having our child alive, with the need to look forward after all that has happened. We know that we are not going against the neighbour on the corner, but a mafia.” Estela: “Sometimes I’m terrified, they ruined his life, but we will never shut up. I believe in God, but with all that has happened I’ve fallen out with him. Where is the justice that you promised us?” Fernando adds: “They offered to move us to another province, with a house and everything. They wanted our silence. But we will never do it. Because it’s always the most humble that pay, the boys of the poor neighbourhoods. And they instil fear. But they were wrong about us. We are always going to be here, at marches, everywhere, so that no one else has to go through this.” Another Ending News: The teenage protagonist of Case A is 17 now. He is slowly emerging from his hell, his parents tell me. He works, plays sports, he took another step with his girlfriend, the same one who was with him on that day, and they had a baby. “They wanted to steal his dreams and his life, but now he must think about that little girl, my granddaughter.” Estela smiles, as if asking herself if this will be possible. Antillanca says that it is not a matter of faith or hope, but confidence in the collective work. Fernando: “It’s true. And I bet that we can turn all of this around.”   *Julián Antillanca was found beaten to death in the early hours of 5th September, 2010, shortly after being violently detained by police as he left a nightclub. After a campaign by his father César Antillanca, six police officers were put on trial for his death, but were found not guilty in March 2012. Just over a year later, the Supreme Court revoked the verdict. **Iván Torres was last seen in a police station in Comodoro Rivadavia, Chubut, on 2nd October 2003. Despite many investigations, no-one has been formally charged. In 2011, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights condemned the State of Argentina for the forced disappearance of Torres.

"584484"	"Latin America News Roundup: 13th March 2014"	"Today's news from Latin America: El Salvador: Sánchez Cerén Wins Elections; Another Campesino Leader Killed in Paraguay; Unasur Meets to Discuss Venezuela Crisis"	"El Salvador’s president elect, Salvador Sánchez-Cerén (photo courtesy of Wikipedia). El Salvador: Sánchez Cerén Wins Elections: El Salvador’s Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) has confirmed that FMLN’s Salvador Sánchez Cerén, has won last Sunday’s elections. The former guerrilla won 50.11% of the vote against rival ARENA’s Norman Quijano’s 49.89%. Sánchez Cerén won just 7,000 more votes than Quijano. However, the TSE will not officially declare Sánchez Cerén president elect until they resolve the complaint filed by ARENA on Tuesday alleging vote fraud, a claim that is not seen to carry weight by election observers, including the OAS. The new president will take office for a five year period on 1st June, in what is seen to be an historic inauguration, the first time two left-wing candidates have succeeded one another in the Central American state. FMLN is planning on celebrating Sánchez Cerén’s victory in the main square of the country’s capital, San Salvador. Paraguay: Another Campesino Leader Killed: Yesterday, campesino leader Eusebio Torres was shot dead in his home in Santa Lucia in the eastern department of Alto Paraná. According to lawyer Óscar Ortiz, two men arrived on motorbike, and without any exchange of words, opened fire on the president of the Landless Neighbours Commission. The 64-year-old had reported to the National Institute for Rural and Land Development (Indert) that 3,000 hectares of public land was being illegally used for agriculture, by Brazilian soy producers. Secretary of the Farmers Association of Alto Paraná, Tomás Zayas, responded to the killing saying that the “soy mafia” were responsible, and that Torres was not the first to have been threatened after reporting illegal crop production, noting that other campesino leaders had left the region after threats. Since June 2012, at least seven campesino leaders have been violently killed by strangers in different parts of Paraguay. Unasur Meets to Discuss Venezuela Crisis: Foreign ministers of the Unasur countries are met today in Chile to discuss the on-going tensions in Venezuela, which have left 22 dead since protests began a month ago. After the meeting in Santiago, the foreign ministers announced the formulation of a delegation to accompany ”a political dialogue to recuperate peaceful coexistence” in the country. The group will be made up of foreign ministers of member states and will travel to Venezuela during the first week of April, as part of the on-going National Peace Conference, an open process that the Venezuelan government is promoting in an effort to boost dialogue between political and social actors from all sides of the unrest. The Unasur delegation called on the Venezuelan opposition to join the government in this peaceful dialogue. Unasur’s announcement comes a day after Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro met with student leaders in his first face-to-face meeting with the opposition youth movement."

"Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos (Photo: Facebook official account) Colombia – Top Army Generals Removed due to Corruption Scandal: The Colombian government announced yesterday the dismissal of several Army generals after a corruption scandal within the Armed Forces was revealed by the press on Sunday. Armed Forces Commander, General Leonardo Barrero, as well as four other top-ranking generals were dismissed. Whilst Barrero was not accused of corruption, President Juan Manuel Santos informed that he was discharged for using “disrespectful” terms against the country’s judiciary. The investigation published on the weekend by Semana magazine quotes Barrero as telling one of the main accused, Robinson González del Río, to “set up a mafia to denounce prosecutors and all that rubbish,” referring to investigations over ‘false positive’ killings for which González del Río is in prison. Families of victims of ‘false positive’ killings have announced they will sue Barrero before the International Criminal Court (ICC) for obstruction of justice. The other dismissed generals, said Santos, “have to go because they knew about the irregularities and didn’t do anything.” Venezuela – Opposition Leader to Testify Today: Opposition leader Leopoldo López is expected to testify before a court in Caracas today over his role in last week’s demonstrations, which left three people dead. After his arrest yesterday, a video recorded earlier was posted to his Twitter account. In it, he says he “does not regret what we have done so far” and encourages his followers to organise themselves and to fight, through “non-violent means”, for the “exit of the government.” López is currently awaiting for his court hearing in the Ramo Verde military prison, outside of Caracas, “for security reasons”, according to his lawyer Enrique Sánchez Falcón. On Tuesday, president Nicolás Maduro stated that ultra right-wing groups were planning to murder López in order to “create a political crisis.” His transfer to Ramo Verde was supervised by the president of the National Assembly, Diosdado Cabello. In an interview with CNN, López’s wife, Lilian Tintori, confirmed that Cabello “escorted him [to the prison] because there were murder threats against Leopoldo López and the government was concerned about the situation and about looking after Leopoldo’s safety.” As more demonstrations are announced for the coming days, it was informed that 22-year old Génesis Carmona, a beauty queen and marketing student who was shot yesterday at a students’ protest, passed away in hospital today due to the wounds, bringing the death toll to four since last Wednesday. Paraguay – Search for Remains of Disappeared Re-Started: The Directorate for Reparation and Historic Memory of Paraguay began today a new round of searches to find the remains of people disappeared by the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner (1954-1989). A team consisting of policemen, judges, and prosecutors ordered that the searches be carried out in Caazapa, in southern Paraguay, after funds were released by the government. Though the focus is on finding the remains of guerrilla leader Juan José Rotela, experts think they could find over 200 bodies. It is believed that the Stroessner regime killed and disappeared 425 people, 50 of which have already been found in previous excavations."

"432269"	"Un Techo para mi País: Building on Shaky Foundations"	"Julia Muriel Dominzain analyses the model used by international NGO 'Un Techo para mi País' and asks the uncomfortable question: who is it really benefitting?"	"***Article originally published in Spanish with the title ‘Un Cheto Para mi Pais‘ in Revista Crisis.*** Corporate social responsibility is as easy to criticise as telling a cashier: “no, I don’t want to donate my change.” But behind the façade of philanthropy and marketing is a more complex universe: someone who had nothing now has something. What is this? An imposture that thrills both the recipient and the donor? ‘Un Techo para mi Pais’ (A Roof for my Country) is the global tutorial for patching things up with faulty patches. However, it doesn’t seem to be for nothing either. ‘Un Techo’ (photo: Sebastián Vricella) Posh people building shitty houses. Can we call it this? Let’s see: what ‘Un Techo…’ builds in eight Argentine provinces and 19 Latin American countries is a wooden pine rectangle, three metres by six, hardly wider than a shipping container, without thermal insulation in the walls or the floor, without electricity, without a bathroom, without a kitchen, and with a final cost of $11,000, the price today of a ’91 model Fiat. In winter it’s cold, really cold, and it will be hot, really hot, in summer. To take a piss, you have to go outside; you cook where you can. Fifteen 30cm posts separate the floor from the mud: wind passes underneath, it enters the house. Here it is, the first trap of Techo, the semantics: to say “roof” implying that it is equivalent to housing, to a home, warmth, dignity, mate, stews, rights, and a life in your own home. As if ‘Techo’ – a roof – were itself a house. There is, then, a so-called house and a deception – which we could call a “marketing trap 2.0”, “attractive campaign” or “naïve mantra”- behind which there is a hoard of young people between 18 and 30, students of business at UADE, psychology at UP, or engineering at El Salvador, all well-meaning and convinced in their goal: “We are seeking to eliminate poverty in Latin America.” That is what the 600 or so Argentine volunteers say when they get up on Saturday morning to throw themselves into manual work, to go and build in more than 90 neighbourhoods and settlements throughout the country, where they have been working since 2003. The same people who now reassess: “Yes, we know we build emergency housing, it’s not final, but we do community work and we want to have an influence in public policies and find definitive solutions for land ownership and services.” They are the people that decided that Techo- as it is now called for short- an NGO funded by big multinationals, will not talk about the structural causes of poverty: “We don’t look to point blame, we just get on with it,” they state. Nail some wood and patch up the system without questioning why. Ok. Julio, a resident in the Los Quinchos neighbourhood in Florencio Varela, is about to enter for the first time the place where he will live with his four children, wife, and two grandchildren. He has no objections – why would he? Julio is an evangelist, verbose, does odd jobs, and is not thinking about what the State should be doing or not. Nor is he interested in discovering the hidden marks of symbolic violence or define if this qualifies as charity, as welfare, or whatever. Julio – who until recently lived under disjointed metal sheets, between pieces of brick held together by what must have been faith, and directly on the mud – is crying. He is crying a lot and knows if he cries a little more he won’t be able to speak. So he controls it to say something from the heart: “Thank you very much to the company and may god bless you.” Everyone pauses. Zoom in on Julio. Big bang: thousands of ‘Julios’ thank the companies for being the closest they have ever been to having the constitutional right to live with dignity. And all thanks to Techo, which has the formula to connect those who have nothing and those who have everything, and to make it sufficiently attractive so that, in ten years, 40,000 volunteers have already participated in the construction of 6 million emergency homes. Once again the multinational has the best costume at the party – it looks good, and it can look at everyone and say: “Tada! You see? We can do business and, at the same time, be socially responsible.” The beneficiary of a new house is interviewed by ‘Techo’ (photo: Sebastián Vricella) The organisation’s funding model is not limited to mass collections in the street with balloons, or individual donations via credit card, or the rounding up of change in supermarkets, or the wine tastings, golf tournaments, celebrity galas or the annual alliances with big companies. They have, as well, a star product inspired by the trend of corporate volunteering, which in itself is an expression that comes from an oxymoron that arose in mid 20th century Unites States: corporate philanthropy. “In the plan ‘Build with your business’ we ask for money but also that they come and involve themselves and see the reality first hand,” explains Ana Ramírez, assistant director of fundraising at Techo in Buenos Aires. It works like this: the companies donate double the cost of the number of shacks they want – the money that is not used for houses goes to the general funding of the NGO – and they send their own employees to work on the construction. People from various hierarchies and areas go, and no previous knowledge is needed: the shacks are designed so that a Youtube tutorial and a weekend is enough. This is the deal chosen by, for example, General Electric, Santander Bank, Chevron, Zurich, Disney, Coca Cola, Molinos, Johnson and Johnson, The Golden Arches, and the telecommunications giant Claro, which has invested in 160 shacks for different districts of the country. Keeping in mind just the ten recently assembled in Florencio Varela, Claro contributed about $220,000 and more than 100 employees. For this, Julio thanks the company. Because 48 hours ago, in a neighbourhood on the outskirts of Buenos Aires that doesn’t appear on maps, he and his family, four young volunteers, a girl from a call centre, a manager and his daughter, an accountant, and an employee from human resources strained, lunched, dug, hammered, sweated, and were moved together. When the house took root – when they buried the 15th and last post of the base – they cried. In this moment, they had to write a wish on a piece of paper to be read aloud and thrown to Pachamama (Mother Nature). One of the volunteers said: “I wish that, like, this will be the base for the future of the family, and that, like, you will be very happy.” Now that everything is ready, that each nail is holding up what it should be, that the beams are in a perfect grid, that the corrugated metal sheets are covered with insulating glass wool, and the coloured balloons are hung on the door, the last ritual of the weekend commences. The whole crew is gathered in front of the entrance, with dirty shirts, out-of-control hair, and semi-buried shoes. A close-up of their eyes shows they are not thinking that tomorrow is Monday and all that it brings; they are watching what is happening here. A detail shot of nails full of dirt proves they gave their bodies for the cause. Julio and his daughters walk towards the door, uncomfortable with the show but happy with the recently baked house. Someone hands them scissors and Julio cuts the ribbon. After, they turn around not knowing what else to do. The producer of [local tv show] ‘Surprise and a Half’ is not there to tell them which camera to look into and there is no soundtrack of violins. Nor is there a neon sign, but the live audience applause, shout and celebrate, they rejoice and think: ‘wow, it was great to help!’ Volunteers help construct a house (photo: Yluux, via flickr) The same model they offer to companies is a success with private secondary schools – a class raises the money and off it goes to the neighbourhood-, with families – uncles, cousins, in-laws, and nephews of volunteers donate and get to work with their own hands-, and with Jeff, a student of international relations in Massachusetts, who has just finished, a few metres from here, the 11th house of the weekend. This proactive North American paid US$4,000 for the experience and travelled especially to end up surprised by the “feeling of teamwork.” Jeff says when he first arrived at the plot where they would be building, a neighbour began to speak to him effusively and he didn’t know how to tell him that he didn’t speak Spanish and “it was so funny.” He also says he wants to get to know Argentine steak, dance and wine, but this will come later. Jeff contacted Techo through a branch the organisation just opened in Miami to attract funds from international and private organisations and NGOs working with Holy Cross, a university that has Jesuit origins like Techo. All very Pope Francis. The second and final work day of corporate volunteering with Claro in Florencio Varela has just ended and… congratulations! Everybody wins. The employees, who are elated and full of adrenaline waiting for the minibus to take them back to the capital, won. “It’s cool to know that a company supports you and encourages you to do something like this: I’m happy and proud to be part of it,” said the head of internal communications at Claro. The Techo volunteers also won – like Mer, Pato, and Vicky, who have reaffirmed their commitment and are sitting to the side debating whether or not to participate in the next construction. Claro won: not because of the “tax deductions” as we love to say when Coto asks us if we want to donate our change, but because of the self-indulgence in good deeds and the self-congratulatory solidarity work. Claro won from the outside, if it wanted to publicise its actions. But Claro mainly won from the inside: the human resources department licks its lips because “instead of going to paintball, we stimulate working in a team by helping someone,” explains a volunteer. Jeff, who will return to North America to talk about the asado, tango and team spirit that characterised the Argentines, won. Julio and ten more families, who now have someplace to go, also won. An unknown neighbourhood won because someone paid attention to it. Carlos Slim, owner of Claro and number one in the Forbes ranking, won, because he has a company with more motivated employees and – as Techo’s slogan says – “links as strong as a house”. Over and out. There is something pornographic in the fact that Julio and the richest guy in the world both won. The shack isn’t free for everyone, or better said, for anyone. The agreement is transparent: those who show willingness will receive it in return, and there are three devices to measure this. Whoever wants a shack must pay $720, attend two meetings, and participate actively in the construction. “The money is symbolic, to demonstrate the commitment and say ‘look, I worked my arse off’” says Victoria. With 720 symbolic pesos they could buy 100 litres of symbolic milk or 40 kilos of symbolic rice and all would be symbolically fed. The meetings are exclusionary: “If they don’t come, they get unassigned [housing].” They work side-by-side to move away from the concept of welfare, which Techo are profoundly afraid of. They demand for the poor “that there is an intention to move forward and a lot of willpower to fight for it,” Ana Ramírez describes. Techo isn’t for the poor who like being poor. So, for those who have not lost hope the NGO has a lot of community development strategies to suggest to them: “We work so that we don’t need to exist – we want to create communities that don’t need us, that are autonomous,” explains Victoria Moreno, in her early-twenties and head of internal communication of Techo Argentina. As a result, in the neighbourhoods, there are games libraries for children, round table discussions with neighbours, trade workshops, tutoring, and a micro-loans programme inspired by the Bangladeshi Muhammad Yunus. This banker, Noble Peace Prize winner and, for the organisation, an inescapable role model, wrote in his book ‘Creating a World Without Poverty’ that poor people are like bonsai trees that society never gave the base to grow on. If given real opportunities, says Yunus, they will grow as tall as the rest. Yunus created Grameen Bank, the first finance company to notice that poor people can also repay money. Under that same logic, Techo grants mirco credits. Now, rising out of poverty doesn’t depend on anything but the choices and willingness of the individual. Every weekend Techo deploys between 600 and 1,000 young people in the most needy areas of Argentina. Which ones are they? They don’t need to be told because they have their own “land registry” to look for settlements around the country, survey them, and release the results. According to the report that was presented at the end of last year, they claim 700 volunteers have covered 60% of the country and improved their methodology. “In a normal country, not having a property title would be enough, but here there is so much informality in land ownership and services, it was more difficult to define the method,” explains Juan D´Attoli, National Director of the Land Registry in the NGO’s Social Research Centre. “In the 2011 report there were mistakes: with the parameters we were using, you could enter a ‘country’ (gated community) as a settlement,” commented Moreno regarding the information that made the front page of most newspapers. “The most important thing is that we know where the settlements are and we want the municipalities to use the data to generate public policies,” says D’Attoli. “We are in the neighbourhoods,” he stresses. They are. One Saturday in August, while they are constructing in Los Quinchos, giving out micro credits in Virrey del Pino, and conducting a survey in Córdoba, in the IAPI neighbourhood of Quilmes someone is taking the first steps to define who will be next to receive a shack. This person is 24-year old Mariano, and he follows the standard procedure: he visits the families, surveys them, puts the results through a common sense filter, and notes down the priority as appropriate: high, upper middle, middle, lower middle, low. In this first operation lies the fortune of the homeless. The house of Esteban, a 26-year old who lives with his wife and his seven-year old daughter, is made of mud and dissolves a little with each shower of rain. Mariano asks about income, about services. And makes notes. He calculates by eye the size of the house and the state of the walls. And makes notes. Mariano asks if anyone in the family has an illness and if there are any unwanted pregnancies. And makes notes. “What are the problems that most concern you about the neighbourhood? I’ll tell you the options: housing, jobs, drugs, violence, juvenile crime, rubbish, unwanted pregnancies, lack of schooling,” he asks. “Violence… juvenile crime,” Esteban stammers. “Perfect. I will add rubbish because everyone says rubbish, see,” he decides. What do you like in the neighbourhood? That’s if you like something. If not, I’ll put ‘nothing’.” “It’s peaceful…” “Peaceful? You told me there is violence and crime but it seems peaceful to you?” Mariano is logical, relaxed, like everyone in the organisation. Mariano interacts with the neighbours pretending they are equals. “I won’t build this house for you because there is a conflict with the family behind: in cases like this, better avoid the trouble,” says Mariano, while asking for more ketchup for his hamburger. The saleswoman, who already knows him, who has seen him in the neighbourhood, comments that she is surprised they are here this Saturday because it is a public holiday. And Mariano replies: “How could we not come? Poverty knows no holidays.” For more about Revista Crisis, visit the website here or Facebook page."

"Protests in Altamira, Caracas (photo: José Romero/Télam/lz) Venezuela’s Government and Opposition in Peace Talks: Venezuela’s Government’s Federal Council is meeting today in Caracas to discuss possible ways to tackle the on-going unrest that has braced the country for nearly two weeks. The Council was originally due to meet last Monday to discuss the government’s new Security Plan, but the three right-wing governors boycotted the meeting in response to the government’s handling of opposition protests. The Federal Council is made up of representatives from all levels of government – national, regional, municipal and civil society – whose objective is the harmonised development of the country’s regions. The talks come after more pro-government and opposition protests took place over the weekend. Attorney General Luisa Ortega Díaz has confirmed 13 deaths related to the uprising which began on 12th February, including that on Friday night of a 29-year-old man on a motorbike, who was beheaded by a wire strung across an avenue in Caracas. The wire had allegedly been put there by protesters who had set up a road block in the same location earlier that evening. Photos have been published of other locations in Caracas where protesters have stretched wires across the streets in an apparent effort to impede the passage of motorcyclists who are alleged to have been attacking protesters. Authorities have accused retired general Angél Omar Vivas Perdomo, who is an open critic of the government, of having encouraged protesters to put wires across streets and have ordered his detention. In response today, a motorbiking association organised a ride for peace in support of Maduro’s government. Mexican ‘Most Wanted’ Drug Lord Arrested: Joaquín ‘El Chapo’ Guzmán, head of the Sinaloa Cartel and the most-wanted drug trafficker in the world, was arrested early on Saturday morning in the city of Mazatlán, in west Mexico. His capture was the result of several months’ work coordinated by Mexican and US authorities, culminating in an “impeccable” operation in which not a single shot was fired. Guzmán faces multiple drug charges in the United States and has been on the Drug Enforcement Agency’s top ten most wanted list for more than a decade. His Sinaloa Cartel smuggles cocaine from Colombia through Mexico to the United States, as well as being involved in the production, smuggling, and distribution of methamphetamine, marijuana, and heroin. Guzmán was originally captured in Guatemala in 1993, extradited and sentenced to 20 years in prison in Mexico for murder and drug trafficking, but he escaped maximum security prison Puente Grande in 2001 after bribing prison guards. His drug empire stretches throughout North America, but also reaches as far away as Europe and Australia, and his fortune is worth a reported US$1bn. Ecuador Municipal Elections: President Rafael Correa’s Alianza PAIS (AP) faced defeat in yesterday’s municipal elections, which saw the opposition take power in Quito, Guayaquil, and Cuenca. AP won in nine of 23 municipalities, but lost the major urban centres. In Quito, mayor Augusto Barrera lost to Mauricio Rodas whilst in the country’s second city, Guayaquil, opposition mayor Jaime Nebot celebrated his re-election. Correa admitted that the defeat in Quito was a heavy blow, as the capital “has a lot to do with stability”, and appealed to the mayor-elect to work together with the government. The AP has been in power since 2007 and yesterday was the first electoral defeat after nine wins. Celebrated Uruguayan Artist Páez Vilaró Dies: Uruguayan artist Carlos Páez Vilaró died this morning in Montevideo, aged 90. The prolific artist worked as a painter, potter, sculptor, muralist, writer, composer and constructor. He was perhaps best known for his “liveable sculpture” creation of Casapueblo, close to Punta del Este, on Uruguay’s coast, which has been a leading tourist destination since the 1960s."

"President Rafael Correa talks to the press (photo: Government of Ecuador) Ecuador – President Announces Cabinet Reshuffle: After Sunday’s electoral defeat in key districts, president Rafael Correa announced upcoming changes to his cabinet and his party, Alianza País (AP). “I will ask all cabinet ministers to hand in their resignation [today],” said Correa in a press conference yesterday, as he stated that his cabinet needs “some oxygen.” The changes, he said, had been decided previous to the election. The president said that it “hurt” to have lost in important districts such as the capital Quito, Guayaquil, and Cuenca, but added that “the shake-up was welcome, because I think we were stagnating -not the government, but the political organisation at the local level.” Changes in local leadership positions within AP are expected to follow. Guatemala – Minister Warns About Climate Change Effects: Agriculture Minister Elmer López warned that over a million Guatemalans could suffer from the effects of climate change on crops in the second half of the year. Talking to local newspaper La Hora, López said: “Right now we have a million people living in the Dry Corridor, who may reach a crisis point if the situation turns extreme due to climate change. This means we could have over three weeks without rain in the hottest period of summer. And if this period extends to more than three weeks, the crops could die.” The minister also informed that the country will soon start receiving grains from the World Food Programme to face the impending shortage, and that the government has earmarked Q62m (US$8m) from its budget to purchase food from the current harvest and for projects aimed at assisting small producers. According to official estimates, 933,000 families were affected by seasonal food shortages last year. Malnutrition is a perennial problem in Guatemala. Venezuela – Opposition Rejects Calls for Dialogue: The Venezuelan opposition rejected president Nicolás Maduro’s call for a “national dialogue” today. Maduro made the call on Monday, and so far the Catholic Church and business representatives have agreed to participating. In a letter sent to vice-president Jorge Arreaza, however, the opposition coalition Mesa de Unidad Democrática (MUD) said they would not attend what they consider “a simulation” and “mocking our fellow countrymen.” They also blamed the government for the situation the country is in, after two weeks of protests which have left 14 people dead."

"Teachers demand a $6,400 minimum wage (photo: Carlos Cermele/Télam/jcp) Buenos Aires Teachers Continue Strike: Teachers’ unions rejected the provincial government’s offer for a wage increase and will continue with the strike that began on 5th March. After a two-hour meeting at the Labour Ministry, union representatives stated that they “will carry on with the struggle until they give us a reasonable offer.” The government improved their first offer by proposing a 30.9% increase (5.4% more than originally offered) to be paid between March and August, at a cost of $1.2bn. This would bring the salary of a primary school teacher with no previous experience to $4,393 from March and $4,717 from August onwards. Union representative Mirta Petrocini, however, said that “there was no negotiation here. The government came with a closed proposal. We have not been able to intervene in the decision regarding our salary.” Teachers are demanding a 35% increase to be paid in full from March onwards. Five Injured in Construction Site Collapse: Five people were injured this afternoon when the roof of a building site collapsed in the Buenos Aires neighbourhood of Parque Patricios. The wounded workers were taken to nearby hospitals Penna and Ramos Mejía, where they were treated for fractures and other injuries. Alberto Crescenti, director of the city’s emergency services, explained that “the roof gave way and the workers fell down two floors” and confirmed that no one was trapped in the rubble. The head of the Government’s Control Agency, Sebastián Ugarti, said that “we carry out proactive inspections of construction sites every two or three months and this site complied with the law. It was within the parameters.” The construction site belongs to private health insurance company OSDE. Unions and Social Movements Protest Against Inflation: A group of activists from the Argentine Workers’ Union (CTA) and from different social movements are protesting today against “the worsening of the workers’ situation due to the devaluation and inflation.” The CTA faction led by Pablo Micheli, which opposes the national government, marched between 9 de Julio and Avenida de Mayo towards Plaza de Mayo.

"San José de Flores subte station (photo: Beatrice Murch) Subte Fares to Increase: Subte fares in the city of Buenos Aires will increase as of next Friday 14th March, from the current $3.50 to $4.50 for rides purchased with electronic cards, such as Sube and Monedero. Tickets bought in cash will cost $5 each, and the premetro will go up from $1 to $1.50. Those travelling more than 20 times per month will see the price of the 21st to the 30th ticket reduced to $3.60; the 31st to 40th will be reduced to $3.15, and all the trips from the 41st onwards will cost $2.70. The measure was published in the City’s Official Gazette this morning, and justified by a yearly rise in costs of 16%. The City’s General Auditor, Eduardo Epszteyn, criticised the rise, indicating that a report produced by his office at the legislature’s request found the subte‘s operational costs to be significantly lower than those mentioned by the government. “I can’t understand how [Mayor Mauricio] Macri’s government could reach that value. Their costs are grossly inflated,” he said. Macri to Avoid Trial Over Wiretapping: A judge ruled that there is not enough evidence to bring Buenos Aires City Mayor Mauricio Macri to trial over the 2009 wiretapping scandal. Former Education Minister Mariano Narodowski, former Metropolitan Police chief Jorge ‘Fino’ Palacios, and alleged spy Ciro James will undergo trial. Judge Sebastián Casanello considered that neither the prosecutor or the complainants “specify direct evidence supporting the allegation that Macri ordered that Néstor Leonardo and Sergio Burstein be spied on.” According to Casanello, the political responsibility that may be attributed to the Mayor is insufficient for criminal proceedings. Despite this latest development in the case, Macri is still prosecuted and the judge has ordered new evidence to be presented to him in order to decide whether to acquit him or to bring him to trial with the rest of the accused. Buenos Aires Province Teachers to Strike Next Week: Teachers’ unions in the province of Buenos Aires confirmed they will go on strike on Monday and Tuesday next week. In a statement, the Teachers’ Unions Front (FGDB) said that they will “continue with the struggle until we receive a wage offer from the government that can be analysed by the teachers.” The FGDB has rejected the provincial government’s offer of a 25.5% wage increase, as they demand at least a 35% raise. Schools in the province did not start the term as expected this week due to the strikes."

He was killed in the community of Luz Bella, in San Pedro department in northern Paraguay. The organisation is calling for an audience with authorities form the Interior Ministry and the Attorney General to demand explanations over the motives and circumstances surrounding Benítez’s death. The FNC has highlighted that the day before his death, Benítez had participated in a protest against deforestation and soy fumigation, which was repressed by police, resulting in 16 injured and one arrest. The FNC’s Teodolina Villalba said the police were there on behalf of landowners, to ensure the clearing and deforestation for a new soy plantation went ahead without any interruptions. As Benítez – who had tended to those wounded by the police – was killed less than 24 hours later, the FNC believe that his death may have been a “settling of accounts”. Bank of Brazil’s Former Director Arrested in Italy: Former director of Banco do Brazil Henrique Pizzolato has been arrested in Maranello, Italy. He fled Brazil in November after being found guilty of money laundering and corruption, and faces 12 years and 7 months in prison. Using his dead brother’s passport, Pizzolato, who has Brazilian and Italian citizenship, crossing from Brazil into Argentina, took a flight to Spain and from there made it to his nephew’s house in Italy, where he was picked up by police yesterday. The Brazilian government has started extradition proceedings. Pizzolato is said to have created a parallel accounting system to pay bribes to legislators of the Partido de los Trabajadores, in exchange for their votes, between 2003 and  2005. He authorised the money to be paid to an advertising agency, who then distributed the bribe money. Colombian Prison Fire Death Toll Rises: The death toll from last week’s prison fire has risen to 16, after two of the victims succumbed to their injuries in the early hours of this morning. Both had been suffering from third-degree burns. The 28th January fire, which took place in the northern city of Barranquilla, was the first prison fire in 14 years, and started when prisoners set fire to mattresses during a confrontation between rival groups in one of the jail’s patios. Authorities in Barranquilla have since denounced the conditions of the prison, called Carcel Modelo, which holds 1200 people, triple the facility’s capacity of 400. According to the country’s penitentiary authorities, the overcrowding is common – the country’s jails have room for just over 75,000 prisoners, but they currently hold over 116,000."

The IPC-Nu replaced the IPC-GBA at the end of last year, and is hoped to reflect variations in prices more accurately, using a new IMF-approved methodology. While the average price rise was 3.7%, Kicillof gave a breakdown of the price rises, which showed disparities between different sectors: food and drinks rose by 3.3%; clothing 0.8%; housing and basic services 2.2%; furniture and homeware 4.3%; medical attention and healthcare 5.9%; transport and communications 5.4%; leisure 4.8%; education 1.6% and other goods and services 1.6%. Referring to the price rises, he said that there had been a “climate of psychosis” in the country since December, which had led to big shifts in prices in the first month of the year, which could be largely attributed to speculation. The inflation figure is much closer to that of private indexes, which registered a rise of 4.6% during January. Critics have noted that if the pattern continues, the annual inflation figure will be around 40%. La Salada on ‘Notorious Markets’ List: Argentina’s La Salada, the largest black market in South America, has featured on the United States’ Notorious Markets List for the fourth year running. The 2013 Out of Cycle review of Notorious Markets, published today, compiled a list of online and physical spaces known for trademark counterfeiting and copyright piracy on a commercial scale, which cause “significant losses for rights holders and legitimate businesses”. All the physical marketplaces listed were in Asia or Latin America, with La Salada accompanied in the Americas by Paraguay’s Ciudad del Este, Mexico’s Tepito market in Mexico City and San Juan de Dios in Guadalajara, Ecuador’s Bahia Market in Guayaquil and Colombia’s chain of San Andresitos markets, in Bogotá, Cali and other cities. La Salada is noted as being the largest market in Latin America, and was recently noted by the European Union as being the region’s largest smuggling centre. Journalists Threatened in Mendoza: Mendozan authorities have granted police protection to three journalists after a concrete threat was revealed against three journalists from the provincial newspaper El Sol. The threat comes from a drug trafficking gang known as Los Angelitos de la Yaqui, who are suspected of running a cartel in west Godoy Cruz. The journalists had been investigating the gang’s role in the drug trade, and it would appear that Sandra Yaquelina Vargas, who is said to be the leader of the gang, told her “angelitos” to con “something” to the journalists. Provincial prosecutor, Claudia Ríos, who granted the journalists’ protection, is now investigating the gang."

"575222"	"Tol-Haru: Earthship Architecture in Tierra del Fuego"	"Pioneering architect Michael Reynolds brought his eco-friendly Earthship construction to Ushuaia, building Tol-Haru educational centre with 200 volunteers from around the world."	"Earlier this summer, a team of 200 volunteers from around the world descended on Ushuaia to help build Tol-Haru, a 100% sustainable building that will act as an educational centre. Tol-Haru is Argentina’s first ‘Earthship’, and it is hoped that its construction will raise awareness of alternative ways of building, which work more in harmony with their environments. Earthships are the brainchild of Michael Reynolds, an architect from the US who has spent the past 40 years experimenting with building techniques, and in designing the Earthship he has created a building that is “the epitome of sustainable design and construction”. The Ushuaia Earthship, Tol-Haru, is set against a dramatic backdrop (photo courtesy of Earthship.com) The constructions are made from around 50% recycled materials and are designed to function entirely off the grid, with solar panels to heat water and provide the power needed. The flat roof collects rainwater, up to 90% of which is recycled through a grey-water recycling system, meaning that such buildings are an option even in desert-like conditions. Thick external walls made of old tyres retain heat and provide insulation, keeping the indoor temperature a comfortable 20-22ºC year round. Reynolds’ experimental buildings in New Mexico were the subject of 2007 film ‘Garbage Warrior’, which sees the architect struggle through battles with building regulation bureaucracy, and also follows his team to the Andaman Islands after the 2005 tsunami, witnessing them help locals rebuild using Earthship techniques. The fame generated by the documentary catapulted the Earthship concept to a new level, and now the team behind the constructions run academies for enthusiasts, have released a series of e-books on building techniques, and sell construction drawings, which are designed to meet standard building codes, meaning there are now hundreds of Earthships around the world that aficionados have built. Michael Reynolds teaching at the Ushuaia Earthship academy (photo courtesy of Earthship.com) There is even a section on the website entitled ‘I Want One’, aiming to give dreamers honest information about living in such a home, with realistic facts intertwined with anecdotes from builds that have been commissioned. Reading the section, and talking to Reynolds, you realise that this is much more than just construction -there is an entire life philosophy behind these buildings. Reynolds is realistic about climate change and western society’s dependency on fossil fuels, and sees the Earthship as a form of empowerment, giving people energy, food, and water security, and as a consequence, the ability to take care of themselves, in a time when so many are dependent on corporations or government to do so for them. One chapter, entitled Tomato Security, states: “We have had people ask us to build them Earthship communities with underground chambers for weapons and ammunition. When we ask them why, their answer is: ‘we are going to have our lives together and we need weapons and ammo to protect ourselves from others who will want to take it from us.’ This made us think and we came up with the answer that even if you have the stomach to kill starving people who are coming after your tomatoes, there are not enough walls and weapons to protect you and your tomatoes from all the world around you that has yet to find an approach to secure sustenance. Your best security is for everyone within five hundred miles of you to have what you have. If you let logic prevail, you will find that if all those around you could have what you have, why would they want to invade you? This is the foundation of tomato logic.” It seems like a simple logic, but Reynolds is aware that many of the things he is suggesting sound like scary counter-culture in Republican New Mexico, admitting that if too many people decided to build their homes this way, he would probably be shot. But has declared that he no longer fights against the system, laughing, “I just outsmart them.” Tol-Haru Tol-Haru uses renewable energy from solar panels and a wind turbine (photo courtesy of Earthship.com) The Ushuaia project was the initiative of Naturaleza Aplicada a la Tecnología, or NAT, a foundation supported by actor Mariano Torres and his wife, artist Elena Roger. They were joined by local organisation Ushuaia Recicla, which provided 333 old tyres, 3,000 aluminium cans, 5,000 plastic bottles and 3,000 glass bottles for the construction. Torres, a native of Ushuaia, said that in bringing the Earthship technology to the city, he would be giving something back, and hopes that many of the elements used in building Earthships can be implemented by the municipality. Reynolds agrees, highlighting two aspects in the design that he hopes will be particularly useful for Tierra del Fuego’s capital. “The building uses 50% of materials that society throws away. And Ushuaia has a big garbage problem, because it’s on an island and everything is brought in, creating a lot of garbage, and there is no place to get rid of it. So we use what we call ‘garbage’ to build with – bottles, tyres, etc. The building also contains and treats its own sewage on site, so nothing goes into the bay.” He goes on to say that the various aspects of the Earthships are applicable in many ways, to fit in with different environments around the world. This is something he has proven when you see the range of different terrains where the Earthships have been constructed, from New Mexico to El Alto in Bolivia, northern Europe to Sierra Leone. Reynolds says it is easier to build outside of the US because regulations tend to be more lax. “The architectural board in New Mexico thought I was a disgrace to the profession because I was building with garbage. So some people thought I was a disgrace, and others – well, there are rules and some people just go by the rules. They don’t understand that we have to evolve if we are going to stay alive here.” Many of the builds the team have participated in around the world have taken place after disasters, such as after Hurricane Mitch in Honduras, the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, and the 2005 tsunami in the Andaman Islands. The team are, in fact, currently in the Philippines helping rebuild after November’s Typhoon Haiyan. Exotic plants can survive Ushuaia’s harsh weather conditions in the greenhouse (photo courtesy of Earthship.com) I suggest that he is almost the opposite of a disaster capitalist – instead of sweeping into devastated areas and looking how to make the most money possible out of the people’s misery, he goes in and helps empower them to rebuild their lives, exchanging knowledge and teaching techniques that can be replicated after his team have left. He replies, saying: “Disaster creates a situation where people are desperate and they’ll take anything and the rules are put aside. We learn a lot from these disaster projects, and often improve our techniques through the cultural exchange. So it’s kind of a win-win situation – we aren’t doing it to make money, we are just doing it to learn how they – and we – can do this better. An Earthship heats itself without fuel. And it also produces some food. So it is dealing with many of the issues that every single country on this planet faces.” He is particularly proud of their success in Sierra Leone. “We keep tabs on how the houses are doing – they are always doing pretty well, and what we always want is for local people to replicate them, and that happened in Sierra Leone, where we made a school. We only made two rooms of an eight-room school as we didn’t have time, and so we taught them how to do it and they finished the other six rooms on their own. And their work totally looks better than ours! And in other places they are replicating some of the techniques too.” And it seems the concept is already set to be replicated around Argentina and the region. Reynolds and his team will be returning to Argentina next summer to construct a 40-bed hostel in El Bolsón, and are also planning an Earthship Academy in Uruguay this year. They are also fundraising to build a community project for the Qom in Formosa.

"583598"	"‘Caught in the Act’ Theatrical Bike Tour: Riding Through The History Books"	"Theatre company teams up with Biking Buenos Aires to paint Argentine history in a new, interactive, and surprising light. George Nelson goes along for the ride."	"“Your bike is a time machine and you’re going to journey through the pages of Buenos Aires’ incredible history,” says tour guide Jonathan Misrahi, the porteño’s Theodor Geisel-inspired hat sagging as the afternoon sun further illuminates his dazzling waistcoat. A self-styled inventor, entrepreneur, and “actor wannabe”, Misrahi captivates the group as he explains what is to unfold: a voyage through the capital’s vaults, acted out by both a trained cast and ourselves — apparently. Tour guide Jonathan Misrahi narrating the history of Buenos Aires (photo: Ben Salmon-Lord) Caught in the Act: Theatrical Bike Tour — a new collaboration between tour company Biking Buenos Aires and theatrical group Compañía Fårö — delivers a fully interactive series of encounters, designed to “leave you impacted by the experience just as fellow Argentines have for centuries.” We had been warned to expect the unexpected, that we would be drawn into the performances and dragged out of our comfort zones while soaking up the sights of the city. Additionally, we were asked to sign a confidentiality agreement, in the air, promising to keep stum about all that was to occur — for fear of spoiling it for future guests. Slightly mystified and a little worried, our seven-strong gang cycled from the garage on Peru to Parque Lezama, and Argentina’s economic collapse of 200 Actors Osvaldo Pefluffo, Verónika Ayanz, and Claudia Bursuk were waiting for us in the park, standing motionless and disguised behind adapted theatre masks and a sheet tied between two trees. They were already attracting considerable interest from perplexed bystanders. Summoned from our bikes, Misrahi led us to a clearing before explaining the events of 2001. Sadly, due to the pact I signed earlier, I am unable to describe what happened in more detail. However, I will say that it involved making a hell of a racket and chanting at the top of our voices. Our group seemed to be growing as dozens gathered around, the public confused and curious in equal measure, but the rambunctious outdoor theatre continued. As expected, there was also the odd jeer and insolent remark thrown in our direction throughout the afternoon’s performances, but Misrahi and his colleagues shrugged these off with aplomb: water off a duck’s back. Parque Lezama was only the beginning of the four-hour, six-scene tour. Next, we cycled to the port in La Boca and 1894 before transporting a few years later to 1902, also in La Boca — cue comfort zone extraction. A trip to 1942 followed, and a chance to meet one of Argentina’s leading ladies as she shot to fame. Time for a mate and alfajor pit-stop. The three actors stand motionless in Parque Lezama, waiting to recount tragic tales of Argentina’s economic crash of 2001 (photo: Ben Salmon-Lord) Not all Argentine history is so light-hearted though, and Misrahi was quick to remind us of the unforgivable acts that befell Argentina’s last military dictatorship. Outside Club Atlético — the former torture and detention site of abducted civilians — a distressing scene panned out before our eyes, brilliantly acted out by both Peluffo and Bursuk. One moving, Puerto Madero dance routine later and we arrived in Plaza de Mayo to be met by an eerie sight, lit against the backdrop of the Casa Rosada, much to the astonishment of locals and tourists alike. I wish I could tell you more; it was quite a climax to the tour. Misrahi then took centre stage, recounting the words of Spanish novelist Miguel de Unamuno, His 1.90-metre frame vanishing in a heartbeat behind the Manuel Belgrano monument to wild applause. We were then left to contemplate Argentina’s fascinating backlog.   Running for a limited time only, Caught in the Act: Theatrical bike Tour will be unravelling Buenos Aires’ history every Sunday until 20th April. The bilingual tour (in English and Spanish) starts at 4pm in San Telmo. US$45 per person. For more information visit www.bikingbuenosaires.com."

"The ‘Cuban Five’ (photo: Wikipedia) ‘Cuban Five’ Member Returns to Cuba: Cuban intelligence agent Fernándo González, a member of the ‘Cuban Five’, was released from prison in the US and deported back to Cuba. González left the Arizona prison where he completed his sentence on Thursday, and was immediately turned over to the Immigration Department. He was deported and arrived at Havana’s international airport this morning. González was arrested in Florida in 1998 and sentenced to 15 years in prison in 2001 after being found guilty of conspiracy charges and for failing to register as a foreign agent in the US. Both the ‘Cuban Five’ and the government have admitted they were intelligence agents, but claimed to have been informing on terrorist groups within the exiled community in Miami which were planning attacks on the island. González is the second of the ‘Cuban Five’ to have completed his sentence. René González was released in 2013, whilst Antonio Guerrero will be released in 2017, and Gerardo Hernández and Ramón Labañino are serving life terms. Cuban authorities have indicated their willingness to carry out a prisoner exchange, swapping the remaining members ‘Cuban Five’ for US State Department contractor Alan Gross, who is serving a 15-year sentence on the island. Agreement Reached on Panama Canal: The Panama Canal Authority (ACP) announced the end of talks with construction consortium GUPC over the conclusion of the canal’s expansion project. The talks resulted in a “conceptual agreement,” which is still “subject to documentation, review and final signature by the parties.” As the agreement does not modify the price or the terms of the contract, the project – which involves the construction of a set of locks – must be completed by December 2015. It was also agreed that GUPC will pay US$100m and ACP will advance US$100m, which will enable works to return to a normal pace in March. APC administrator, Jorge Quijano, said that “We have reached a conceptual agreement that protects the interests of the Panama Canal, within the terms of the contract and respecting our position.” The conflict broke out when the ACP refused to pay cost overruns of US$1.6bn, which it deemed “exorbitant and unjustified,” and the consortium ordered its sub-contractors to abandon the work sites. GUPC resumed work on the project on 20th February. Brazil – Supreme Court Reduces Corruption Sentences: Eight people who had been found guilty of corruption in Brazil’s ‘trial of the century’ had their sentences reduced by the Supreme Court, including Lula Da Silva’s former Chief of Staff José Dirceu. Six out of the eleven court judges, including two of its newest members, voted to acquit the accused of the charges of conspiracy, which will see their jail terms reduced, and will also exempt them from serving them in a closed prison, doing it instead in a ‘semi-open’ jail in Brasilia. Supreme Court president Joaquim Barbosa said that a “circumstantial majority” was formed specifically “to undermine all the great work carried out by this court on the second semester of 2012.” “It is a sad afternoon for the Supreme Court,” he lamented."

"Family and friends mourn victim of clashes between militias and army (photo: AFP/Alfredo Estrella/Télam/aa) Mexico – Michoacán Militias Agree to “Gradual Demobilisation”: The self-defence groups operating in the Mexican state of Michoacán have reached an agreeement with the federal government by which they will undertake a “gradual demobilisation”. Militia leaders have committed to staying away from urban areas and to doing a “clean-up” within their ranks. Estanislao Beltrán, a spokesman for the militias, confirmed that “we will do a clean-up of all those who are in the towns and who were part of the movement. Those who have problems, who have legal problems and those who are criminals, they will have to pay,” adding that “we don’t negotiate with criminals.” They will also remove barricades in areas “where they are not needed anymore” due to the presence of federal security forces. Militias were formed in Michoacán as a way to protect the population from the criminal activities of drug cartels. Earlier this year, the federal and local governments announced the implementation of a joint strategy to regain control of the state and take over security procedures. Costa Rica – Farmers Denounce Environmental Damage: The North Land and Freedom organisation, in northern Costa Rica, has denounced that the construction of a hydroelectric dam in the area is causing widespread environmental damage. The Bijagua hydroelectric project, carried out by cooperative Coopeguanacaste, is expected to have a capacity of 17.39 MW once completed. However, according to a statement by North Land and Freedom, “the cooperative has opened at least three different work sites and within a few days it has destroyed the protected areas of the Zapote and Bijagua rivers, despite the water law banning works in the banks of rivers and ravines.” The statement also accuses Coopeguanacuaste of removing vegetation in order to build a tunnel and other complementary works in the area. “Even though the environmental impact assessment for the Bijagua Hydroelectric Project was approved on 18th December 2012 (…) this cannot be a blank cheque for the Cooperative to destroy the ecosystems in the region.” North Land and Freedom brings together farmers’ organisations from Upala, Los Chiles, and Guatuso, as well as the Maléku indigenous community. Brazil – Court Recognises Rural Settlement: At least 78 families from the Osvaldo de Oliveira camp obtained their right to own land. This came after four evictions and three years of struggle at the settlement in Macaé, Rio de Janeiro. Last week, judge Eduardo Aidé Bueno de Camargo confirmed the beginning of the process to regularise the situation of the families. In September 2010 the zone had been declared an area of social interest through a decree signed by former president Lula Da Silva. Then, in 2012, the National Institute for Colonisation and Agrarian Reform determined the divestment of the lands. The families are part of the Landless Workers’ Movement (MST).

"BA Minister for Education Esteban Bullrich (photo: Paula Ribas/Télam)Shortage of Space in Public Nursery Schools: Around 7,000 to 9,000 children aged between 45 days and 3 years will not have a place at a public nursery in Buenos Aires in the coming school year, city Minister of Education Esteban Bullrich confirmed yesterday. “We’ve created expectations that we are not able to fulfill,” said Bullrich, claiming that the new online subscription process introduced this year only exposed an existing structural problem of a shortage of state nurseries. Last year, around 6,700 children were not able to access public education facilities. Parents of young children not assigned a spot will have to either pay for a private nursery or make other childcare arrangements. While Bullrich assured that there will be places for all other schoolchildren, another 4,000 families that were erroneously assigned a place at a nearby school are now waiting to be relocated to other schools across the city. Investigation into trade irregularities: Cabient Chief Jorge Capitanich today confirmed that the government was conducting an “exhaustive investigation” into irregularities in the export and import accounts of major companies, according to information compiled by the Central Bank of Argentina (BCRA). The investigation regards companies that are alleged to have exported goods but not correctly record the corresponding inflow of currency, as well as importers that sent money abroad but did not register the influx of goods. Capitanich added that these irregularities amounted to a cumulative total of US$6.8bn. Protests over bus fare hike in Córdoba: Protests erupted in Córdoba today after the city council took just a few minutes to approve a near 30% hike in the bus fare, from $4.10 to $5.30. Social organisations and leftist opposition parties gathered outside the building to criticise the measure, with violent incidents between a small group of protesters and police. Local press report that seven people were arrested and five policemen suffered minor injuries. Provincial legislator for Unión por Córdoba, Nadia Fernández, confirmed today that she would present a bill to reject the increase, which she called a “shameful scam”."

"Flooding in the City of Buenos Aires (photo: María Candelaria Lagos/Télam/lz) Hundreds of People Evacuated Due to Heavy Rain: At least 2,000 people had to be evacuated today as torrential rains hit the province of Buenos Aires. A woman died after being dragged by the water of a creek which had burst is banks in the Greater Buenos Aires district of Almirante Brown, where over 100 people were evacuated. A similar number of people had to be evacuated in Berisso, near La Plata, and around 60 in Luján due to flooding. The towns of San Nicolás, San Pedro, Arrecifes, and Ramallo are also amongst the worst affected, according to Infobae. In the capital, several neighbourhoods flooded, over 100 traffic lights stopped working, and subtes and trains suffered delays and service suspensions throughout the day. In the neighbourhood of Villa Lugano, a service station was struck by lightning, causing a small fire that was quickly put out by firefighters. Consumers Boycott Supermarkets in Protest at Price Hikes: Groups of consumers today took part in a collective boycott of supermarkets and petrol stations in protest at recent price hikes. The movement, named ’7F Apagon al consumo’ (consumer ‘black out’), was shared by thousands on Twitter and Facebook since being created last weekend, though there are no reliable measures of how many people took part today. The president of the Union of Consumers in Argentina, Fernando Blanco Muiño, today supported the measure, saying it was “educational” for consumers. “It is important to make consumers aware of they power they have to unite under a single banner and form a social front against the abuses of economic powers,” Muiño told Télam. In a separate measure, the director of the Federation of Chinese Supermarkets and Associations in Argentina, Miguel Angel Calvete, announced today that over 1,100 Chinese-owned supermarkets in Greater Buenos Aires and Rosario would boycott meat suppliers until next Tuesday to protest “excessive” price increases. Policemen Prosecuted Over Drug Trafficking Links: Eight policemen and an informant were prosecuted in Córdoba yesterday due to alleged links with drug trafficking organisations. They have been accused of seizing drug shipments from drug trafficking groups and handing them over to rival gangs. Two of the officers involved are the former heads of the Anti-Drug Trafficking Division of the Córdoba police between 2009 and 2013. The on-going investigation into the relationship between policemen and drug traffickers has already caused a former security minister and police chief to resign. Vice-President Boudou Submitted Statement Over Ciccone Case: Vice-President Amado Boudou appeared before a judge today over the Ciccone case. After prosecutor Jorge Di Lello requested Boudou be called in to declare yesterday, the vice-president decided to spontaneously appear before the judge and submit two statements detailing his position. In one of the statements, Boudou said that “the process of lifting Ciccone Calcográfica S.A.’s bankruptcy and the payment plan [awarded to it] was the product of a judicial decision, on one hand, and of the discretionary faculties of the head of [tax agency] AFIP.” According to his lawyer, Boudou “will face the court like any other citizen”, rather than requesting immunity due to his elected position. This morning, Chief of Cabinet Jorge Capitanich defended the vice-president and said he is being the victim of a “media lynching”."

"It was near the São Paulo FC stadium that a Santos fan was killed on Sunday. (Photo: Wikipedia)Brazil – Murder of Football Fan Renews Security Concerns Before World Cup: Public prosecutors in Brazil have launched an investigation into the brutal killing of a Santos fan by supporters of rival club São Paulo on Sunday. Marcio Barreto de Toledo was beaten to death after being attacked by a group of men wielding metal bars as he waited at a bus stop near the stadium where the two clubs had just played. Other Santos fans at the bus stop managed to escape without serious injuries. The latest incident has renewed concerns over football violence in Brazil just a few months before the start of the World Cup. According to Globo newspaper, 30 people died in football-related violence in 2013. In other news related to the World Cup, Adidas today confirmed that it would recall two T-shirts after the Brazilian government complained they sexualised the country’s identity and could encourage sex tourism during the tournament. Adidas said the two T-shirts in question were in a limited edition range and only released in the US. “Brazil is happy to receive tourists for the World Cup, but it is also ready to combat sex tourism,” wrote President Dilma Rousseff on Twitter. Costa Rica Files Another Complaint Against Nicaragua At ICJ: Costa Rica today filed a new complaint against neighbouring Nicaragua at the International Court of Justice, in an effort to solve a dispute over maritime territorial limits. The move comes months after Nicaragua drew up blocks suitable for offshore oil exploration in both the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea in areas contested by Costa Rica. Foreign Affairs Minister Enrique Castillo said that Nicaragua was seeking to expand its maritime territory and hoped that the ICJ would make a final decision on the sea border between the two countries. “There are no maritime limits. We are hostages to arbitrary decisions by the Nicaraguan government,” said president Laura Chinchilla at a press conference yesterday. Costa Rica and Nicaragua are already waiting for an ICJ verdict over the contested Isla Calero, and Chinchilla said it could take four years for a decision on this new demand. In January, the ICJ delivered a ruling on a long-running dispute of maritime territory between Chile and Peru. El Salvador – Presidential Favourite Pledges to Ban Metal Mining: Presidential candidate for the FMLN party and favourite to win the run-off vote on 9th March, Salvador Sánchez Cerén, has publicly pledged to prohibit metal mining in the country. “The threat of metal mining is a threat to life,” said Sánchez Cerén at a campaign event in the city of San Isidro, Cabañas, where local press report several anti-mining activists have been killed in recent years. Marcos Gálvez, representative of the National Front Against Metal Mining, responded to the pledge saying: “We celebrate that the FMLN presidential candidate has made this public commitment [...] What we want as a group from the new government is for legislation to ban mining in El Salvador.” Incumbent president Mauricio Funes, also of the FMLN, announced in his 2009 campaign that he was against mining in El Salvador, though the party has made little progress in legislating against it."

According to Télam news agency, Uocra delegate Guillermo Santillán indicated that the fight started when a group of workers went to the site to ask for work and were attacked by people on the inside. Other sources believe today’s incident could be a revenge for a similar confrontation that took place ten days ago, where eight people were wounded. YPF Finds New Oil Reserves: Oil company YPF announced the discovery of an oil field in the province of Río Negro expected to yield 15m barrels of crude. In a statement released today, the state-controlled company informed the reserves were found in the oil well Los Caldenes x-2, 30km north of the city of Cinco Saltos. “This new finding, together with others that were recently announced, is a landmark for YPF’s new management, since it will allow us to develop a new oil field, increase the production of conventional oil, and generate growth and development for the provinces involved and for the country,” said the statement. The exploration block had been inactive since 1999. Football Violence Leaves Ten Wounded: Ten people, including three policemen, were wounded in a brutal fight that broke out just before a football match yesterday evening. The incident took place at around 7pm, before a match between Quilmes and All Boys, when a faction of the Quilmes barra brava attacked a “dissident” group in order to “gain control” of the stands in the club’s stadium. The rival factions used knives, metal bars, and flag poles as weapons. Mario Becerra, the son of the leader of the “dissident” faction, was left fighting for his life when he was kicked and beaten up as he was lying unconscious on the ground. Three people were arrested on the spot, and it has been reported that three barras who were taken to hospital escaped today before being discharged, whilst one remains handcuffed to his bed. Quilmes coach Ricardo Caruso Lombardi said about the incident: “It was a mess, we had no idea of what was going on. We were about to get to the stadium and we heard about what had happened,” adding that “this is bad for the football scene, we have a sick society where everyone wants to solve everything fighting and look how it all ends.”"	"News From Argentina; Round Ups Argentina; football violence; oil reserves; quilmes; union violence; UOCRA; YPF"	"http://www.argentinaindependent.com/currentaffairs/newsfromargentina/argentina-news-roundup-11th-march-2014/"	"2014-03-11 21:38:32"	"2014-03-11 21:31:38"	"85"	"General"	"argentina independent"

"Allende greets Bachelet as outgoing president Sebastián Piñera looks on (photo: AFP/Martin Bernetti/Télam/ef) Chile – Michelle Bachelet Takes Office: Michelle Bachelet, Chile’s first female president (2006-2010) was sworn in today for her second term. The ceremony took place in the Senate building in the city of Valparaiso, and was presided over by fellow Socialist Isabel Allende, daughter of ex-president Salvador Allende and the first woman to hold the presidency of the Chilean Senate. “The historic image of two women simultaneously holding the country’s two highest positions will be seen around the world,” said Allende. Several presidents and representatives from foreign countries attended the event, including Argentine president Cristina Fernández, Brazil’s Dilma Rousseff, Ecuador’s Rafael Correa, Bolivia’s Evo Morales, and Peru’s Ollanta Humala, amongst others. Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro was scheduled to travel to Chile but had to cancel the trip at the last minute and was replaced by his Foreign Affairs Minister Elías Jaua, who said that the government was facing “a violent coup attempt” which had already been neutralised. Bachelet was elected president for the second time on 15th December for the 2014-2018 term. She has promised to undertake major reforms to the education system and the Pinochet-era constitution during her second presidency. The new president is expected to give her first official speech later this afternoon. Venezuela – Two Dead in Protests: Two university students were shot dead in Venezuela last night. One of them was killed during a shootout in the city of San Cristóbal, in the west of the country, which has seen a large number of anti-government demonstrations. The other student died in Ciudad Guayana, in the country’s east. Whilst the government blamed opposition groups for the deaths, saying that they “want dead people so they can force an intervention in Venezuela,” the opposition called for a national protest tomorrow in Caracas. Speaking about the situation in the Caribbean country, Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff announced that the Unasur foreign affairs ministers will hold a meeting tomorrow in order to create a committee to deal with the Venezuelan crisis. The committee “will act as an interlocutor to build a climate of consensus, agreement, and stability in Venezuela,” said Rousseff from Santiago de Chile, where she is attending Michelle Bachelet’s inauguration. Protests in Venezuela are thought to have left around 22 people dead in the last month. Uruguay Lowers Public Rates to Combat Inflation: Economy Minister Mario Bergara announced the government will lower the rates of public services in order to combat inflation, which reached 9.82% in the last year. The announcement came after a meeting between the minister and union representatives. Bergara also mentioned the possibility of decreasing VAT rates in fruit and vegetables’ imports and exports. These measures are expected to cost the Uruguayan state some $US100m and aim to reduce inflation to 7%, the level agreed with the country’s Central Bank. Last year’s inflation is the highest since 2004."

"Estela de Carlotto, head of the Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo (Photo: Deutsche Welle) Abuelas Find Grandchild 110: Today the Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo announced they had ‘found’ grandchild number 110. Estela de Carlotto, head of the human rights organisation, revealed the woman was the child of Liliana Isabel Acuña and Oscar Rómulo Gutierrez, who were disappeared on 26th August 1976. Acuña was five months pregnant at the time of her kidnapping, and her daughter was born in a clandestine prison and then adopted. The woman’s identity has not been revealed. During the press conference, her uncle, Ricardo Gutiérrez, said: “This was a pregnancy that lasted for years and today she was born”. De Carlotto confirmed that the woman had come to the Abuelas on 31st October last year with doubts about her identity. The organisation then accompanied her to the National Commission for the Right to Identity (Conadi) where she left a blood sample, which was then run through the National Genetic Data Bank, where it was discovered that she was the daughter of the disappeared couple. The Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo are a human rights organisation, who work to find the missing children of couples who were disappeared during the 1976-83 dictatorship. An estimated 500 women were pregnant at the time of their disappearance, and many of their children were born in captivity and then adopted out to new families, after which their biological mothers were killed. Large Protest in Support of Las Heras Oil Workers: Hundreds marched through the streets of Buenos Aires yesterday in support of three oil workers convicted of the murder of policeman Jorge Sayago. Hugo Gonzáles, Inocencio Cortés, and José Rosales were sentenced to life in prison in December for the death Sayago during a workers’ uprising in February 2006 in the Patagonian town of Las Heras. Six others were also sent to prison for their role in the uprising, in what human rights organisations are calling a miscarriage of justice. The march, which ended in Plaza de Mayo, saw Nobel Peace Prize winner Adolfo Pérez Esquivel, representatives of the Madres de Plaza de Mayo, Línea Fundadora, and national legislators address the crowd, calling for the men to be pardoned due to “irregularities” in the investigation. Nicolás del Caño, national deputy for the PTS, said: “The trial in which the men were convicted was completely staged with the objective of teaching a lesson to the workers and stopping them from organising and fighting for their rights.” He went on to say the trial was in accordance with the oil corporations and with government complicity. Acts of solidarity were also held in Paris, Madrid, Barcelona, Berlin, Mexico, and Chile. Firefighters Laid to Rest; Investigation into Cause of Fire Opened: Buenos Aires residents were given the chance to pay their respects to those who died during yesterday’s fire as a funeral procession drove through the streets of the capital to a memorial service at Chacarita cemetery. Nine firefighters and first responders were killed when a wall collapsed during a fire at an Iron Mountain storage facility in Barracas. The cause of the fire is still unknown. Prosecutor Marcela Sánchez, who is taking charge of the investigation, will take statements from four Iron Mountain employees, including the security employee, who alerted the authorities to the fire, as well as the firefighters who were at the scene, including those who were injured. Sánchez visited the unit in Barracas yesterday. It is not the first time the corporation’s facilities have set on fire, with fires have taken place on five previous occasions at deposits in North America and Europe, at least two of which are suspected to have been caused by arson. This is, however, the first time that such a fire has ended in tragedy."

"The ‘Spring Without Monsanto’ protest in Malvinas Argentinas (photo: Paola Castillo, via Tierra Negra)Córdoba Rejects Monsanto Environmental Study: The Environment Secretariat for the province of Córdoba yesterday rejected an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) prepared by Monsanto for its seed plant near the town of Malvinas Argentinas. The technical commission in charge of reviewing the EIA concluded that it did not fulfill requirements related to waste disposal and was “insufficiently technical” to be approved. According to a court ruling in January, official approval of the EIA after a public hearing is required before Monsanto can resume construction of the seed plant, which was originally scheduled to begin operating in 2014. The latest decision is a victory for protesters who have been camped outside the plant since September and who filed the legal injunction to block its construction. Sofía Gatica, one of the leading figures in the protest, told local newspaper La Voz de Córdoba: “We are happy with the news, but we are not going to relax until we hear the governor say that Monsanto will leave Córdoba.” A spokesperson for Monsanto told local press that the company would comply with all requirements and prepare a new EIA to be submitted for evaluation. 20 Injured as Police Break Up Protest in Chaco: At least 20 people were injured today when police broke up a protest outside the government house in Resistencia, in the northern province of Chaco. Protesters from Barrios de Pie and other social movements blocked roads and marched to the central Plaza 25 de Mayo to demand increases in benefits and payments to workers’ cooperatives, and social housing. Police dispersed the protest with tear gas, water cannons, and rubber bullets, leaving dozens injured, including some women and children, according to eyewitnesses. Provincial security secretary, Marcelo Churín, said the police acted to protect people’s right to circulate freely on roads. “The governor [Juan Carlos Bacileff Ivanoff] does not permit the blocking of roads… protests can go ahead, but without impacting on the rights of others,” he said on local radio. Supreme Court Orders Even Distribution of Government Ads: The Supreme Court today upheld a ruling that obliges the government to distribute public advertising in a legal and constitutional manner, and support freedom of expression. TV company Artear, which is a part of Grupo Clarín, had filed a complaint over the “discretionary administration of public funds for official advertising”, and the exclusion of its own Channel 13. In upholding the claim, the Supreme Court said that if the State decides to distribute advertising, it must not discriminate against certain media outlets or use it to indirectly impact on press freedom."

The Victim’s Attention and Reparations Unit noted 6,073,453 Colombians have suffered from displacement, terrorist acts, threats, sexual violence, forced disappearance, murder, antipersonnel mines, loss of material goods, kidnapping, torture, or children and adolescents forced to join armed groups. The results were based on two years of research, gathered according to the 2011 Law of Victims and Land Restitution, which aimed to collate the numbers of internally displaced peoples and also increased the spectrum of crimes to be taken into account. The aim of the study is also to support compensation of the victims, for which Col $54.9bn (US$27m) has been set aside by the government. So far, over 350,000 people have received compensation, making Colombia the first country in the world to compensate victims of an armed conflict that has not yet ended. The country has been suffering from an internal conflict since 1964 when the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) took up arms to demand land reforms against the governing elite. Brazilian Protests over Public Transport Fare Hikes: Over 2,000 people took to the streets of Rio de Janeiro yesterday in protest of the latest increase in public transport fares, which bring the price to R$3 from R$2.75. The manifestation, which started peacefully, turned violent after the crowd entered the city’s central station and police fired tear gas to disperse protesters. Dozens were arrested and several wounded, including Andrade Santiago, a television cameraman who was filming the events. Santiago remains in a critical condition in hospital after being struck in the head by an unknown object. Yesterday’s was the latest in a series of recent protests against hikes in the costs of public services, such as transportation, which many are tying to escalating costs of Brazil hosting the World Cup. Mexico: Further Violence in Michoacán: The decapitated heads of four indigenous Purépecha men have been found in the troubled south-western state of Michoacán.

All four went missing in the early hours of Wednesday morning, and were last seen driving together in a truck from the town of La Palma to the Cocucho indigenous community. The discovery comes on the same day authorities found a further 25 bodies in two common graves, all said to be victims of the Caballeros Templarios (Knights Templar) drug cartel.

"Police violently suppressed an anti-Monsanto demonstration (photo: RNMA- Red Nacional de Medios Alternativos) Incidents in Anti-Monsanto Protest: At least four people were injured last night as the provincial police violently suppressed a protest against the establishment of a Monsanto factory in Malvinas Argentinas, Córdoba. Protesters had gathered after 6pm yesterday and marched towards the town hall to demand mayor Daniel Arzani sign a decree banning the multinational from setting up a seed processing plant in Malvinas Argentinas. As they approached the fences placed around the town hall, police suppressed the protest using rubber bullets, tear gas, and batons. Three members of the local organisation ‘Malvinas Assembly Fights for Life’ and a journalist for the National Network of Alternative Media (RNMA) had to be taken to hospital after being beaten and shot with rubber bullets. The journalist, Javier Astrada, said that “the police shot me [in the leg] with rubber bullets from a two-metre distance.” Astrada and two of the Assembly members were released immediately, whilst one of them, Daniela Pérez, who was hit in the head, was kept under observation. After 10pm, mayor Arzani met with three members of the Assembly, however he stated that the final decision over the Monsanto plant lies with the provincial government. Tornado Hits Greater Buenos Aires: A tornado hit the Buenos Aires town of Berazategui at around noon today, causing damages to property and widespread power cuts. The strong winds were preceded by rain and lightning, and caused roofs, signs, and even a car to blow away. The storm also affected a medium-voltage power line, causing widespread power outages in large areas of the city of Buenos Aires. Electricity companies Edenor and Edesur stated that most of the outages were resolved “within 10 minutes” and that services were normalised by 1pm. Berazategui’s Public Works Secretary, Darío Iezzi, informed that two people were injured as a result of the storm and that the local government “is working with the residents of the area to repair the damages.” No Salary Agreement Between Government and Teachers: Chief of Cabinet Jorge Capitanich informed this afternoon that the government and the teachers’ unions were unable to reach an agreement today, after holding a first meeting to discuss wage increases for 2014. Teachers’ representatives met with Education Minister Alberto Sileoni and Labour Minister Carlos Tomada at 2pm this afternoon in order to begin this year’s collective wage negotiations. Teachers are asking for increases of between 42% and 66% from last year’s salaries. Capitanich clarified once more that these negotiations seek to establish “an initial wage”, and that final wages will be negotiated between the unions and the provincial governments. Yesterday, the Chief of Cabinet had suggested that, if an agreement could not be reached through negotiations, “there could be a unilateral proposal by the state.” Meetings are expected to resume on Monday or Tuesday."

"388623"	"Radio Wars: Community Radio Strikes Back"	"In celebration of World Radio Day, Sam Pothecary looks at the phenomenon of community radio in Argentina, and how they are faring since 2009's new media law passed."	"Turn on your transistors, reconnect your analogues, and fiddle your dials: World Radio Day 2014 is upon us. Seeking to “raise awareness about the importance of radio, facilitate access to information through radio, and enhance networking among broadcasters,” 13th February 2014 celebrates UNESCO’s World Radio Day. A day to celebrate radio, to encourage all networks to reach out to their listeners, and a day for all communities to enjoy this low cost medium of communication and information. Photo: Wikipedia But in Argentina, the radio waves are in a crucial stage of transition, or even a tussle, after the passing of the Audiovisual Communication Services Law, in 2009. A law designed to fairly spread the influence of media, to help develop the less powerful areas of it, thus making it more democratic, but, fundamentally, to recognise communication as a human right. So we’re taking World Radio Day as an opportunity to see how the community radios have progressed since the implementation of the law. Community Radio Stations in Argentina Community radio stations began to emerge in Argentina in the mid-’80s, as a powerful tool enabling communities to have their own independent voice. Since its emergence, there have been two social organisations that have been instrumental in the development of the community radio network: the World Association of Community Radio Broadcasters Argentina (AMARC) and the Argentine Forum of Community Radios (FARCO). FARCO defines community radio as follows: “Radio stations that practise radio broadcasting as a community service and see communication as a universal right. That seek to build a common path to support one another and strengthen our peoples’ communication. Radio stations that see themselves as an integral part of the community in which they participate. That exercise the right to communication and, particularly, the right to information. That exercise radio broadcasting as a service, and not simply as a commercially profitable activity. Unlike private commercial radio stations, they do not pursue profits.” And, in 2004, after a substantial network of community radio stations had been established, a collection of social organisations, universities, unions, and human rights organisations formed the Coalition for Democratic Broadcasting to start up a dialogue and to push for the democratisation of broadcasting. Mariela Pugliese, president of FARCO, recalls: “The creation of the Coalition brought together all the old struggles to start to discuss, among all the different sectors, what was the common goal. The democratisation of the word was out of the question, and so was the participation of the non-profit sectors, as opposed to the neoliberal and mercantilist conceptions of communication.” The New Law Once the dialogue was established, the Coalition decided upon 21 points that they presented to the Argentine government in anticipation of a new law. And finally, after many discussion forums and public hearings, the Argentine congress passed the new legislation, known as Audiovisual Communication Services Law (LSCA). Heavily influenced by the 21 points put forward by the Coalition, the law looked to restrict the influence of the main media conglomerates, and to develop the non-profit and public sectors by allocating a greater share of the airwaves (33% for non-profit media, of which community radio is part of) and by supplying some resources for their development. In addition to this, the law created the Federal Administration of Audiovisual Communication (AFSCA), a government body whose aim is to guarantee the right to communication. Pugliese proudly explains: “In a global system where the means of communication are represented by economic power, and which set the public agenda, the LSCA in Argentina has become one of the milestones in the democratic process in our country in the last decade. It was a fight and a victory that empowered those that participated in it.” The façade of FM La Tribu community radio in Almagro (photo courtesy of La Tribu) Implementation of the Law However, four and a half years down the line, the law has yet to deliver on all of its promises, while other challenges have also emerged. One of the biggest problems has been the allocation of 33% of the airwaves to non-profit media. As Rafa López Binaghi, from popular Buenos Aires community radio station FM La Tribu, points out, “there isn’t a clear technical plan put in place to correctly allocate the airwaves. Without it, without knowing what that 100% is, how could we know how much 33% is?” A clear technical plan, which properly categorises the airwaves, and then begins to allocate the frequencies legally and fairly, would help solve this problem. Pugliese adds: “The LSCA included the creation of a technical plan for the whole of Argentina, but they are yet to do this. The timeframe in which they said that they would do this has passed, so it is something they owe us.” Without this plan, it has proved almost impossible to ensure that 33% of the airwaves are reserved for non-profit media. It has also resulted in conflicts between radio stations in the places where the number of existing stations far exceeds the available frequencies. Which leads on to the second major challenge of the new law: the over-saturation of the airwaves. López Binaghi explains: “There is an over-saturation of the airwaves in all of the big cities in Argentina. This is because nobody knows whose frequency is whose, which has resulted in many conflicts for the airwaves. Also it means that it is hard to hear the stations correctly, because it’s difficult to broadcast with such saturation.” Again, it is expected that once a technical plan is established, there will be a clearer mechanism for establishing who can use which frequency, and the conflicts can begin to be resolved. Another issue with the LSCA has been its ability, or inability, to allocate resources equally. The law did not address how much advertisement would be given to each radio station. López Binaghi explains that “one thing that is not within the scope of the law is how much advertising the different media outlets get from the government, so the government has continued to give more money to the private radio stations.” However, there is another method of resource distribution written into the LSCA, known as FOMECA (Development Fund for Non-Profit Audiovisual Media). FOMECA collects 10% of the total amount of taxes collected from media advertisement, which is then distributed out to non-profit radio stations. Unfortunately, during the first three years after the law was passed no money was distributed. Last year, however, for the first time, some money started to be given out through FOMECA. “For three years it wasn’t given out, so we asked, and they started to give a little. Then they told us that they would increase it this year, and they have, by almost three times last year’s amount. It still isn’t quite the amount they promised, but the truth is that they said they would distribute more money, and now they are. We have an excellent dialogue with the government, and so they do listen to what we say,” says Pugliese. The inside of a radio (photo courtesy of La Tribu) The Future Looks… Brighter So, what can be concluded about the progression of community radio since the new law was passed in 2009? Overall, the changes have not been as far reaching as was expected, and hoped. The airwaves are still over-saturated, community radio has not officially taken control of 33% of the airwaves, and the resources are yet to be fairly distributed. But it is certainly not all bad. The law represented a turning point in Argentine media politics, as for the first time it has given non-profit media organisations a clear legal voice. The creation of AFSCA gives community radios a government body to deal with directly, and is a means for distributing resources -even if it has not performed this function perfectly. And pressure to create the long-awaited technical plan is increasing, which will hopefully result in the resolving of frequency conflicts and of over-saturation of airwaves. Pugliese is optimistic about the future of community radio. “Being considered by the law, being subject to public policies, and influencing those policies, shows we are building something. Something we can show without fear, something real. It has changed the way we think about communication, a change from the capitalist way of thinking, and a change in Argentine history. It is going to take time, but we are in a good position.”"	"Analysis; Current Affairs; Human Rights; Social Issues; TOP STORY; community; la tribu; radio; world radio day"	"http://www.argentinaindependent.com/currentaffairs/radio-wars-community-radio-strikes-back/"	"2014-02-13 22:54:57"	"2014-02-13 22:40:27"	"85"	"General"	"argentina independent"

"Brazilian President, Dilma Rousseff (Photo: wikimedia commons) Brazil – Cabinet Reshuffle: Ahead of the upcoming elections this year, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff announced a number of changes to her cabinet yesterday. Chief of Cabinet Gleisi Hoffmann will be replaced by current Education Minister Aloizio Mercadante, as she will take the Senate seat she won in 2010. It is expected that this could serve as a platform for Hoffman to run for governor of the southern state of Paraná. Mercadante, in turn, will be replaced by his vice-minister, José Henrique Paim. Health Minister Alexandre Padilha will also step down as he prepares to campaign for the governorship of the state of São Paulo. Rousseff had announced impending changes to her cabinet last month, which she indicated would take place between January and March, so that some of the ministers could participate in the elections. More changes are expected in the coming weeks. Bolivia – US Withdraws Aid: The US embassy in Bolivia informed that its government will no longer fund cooperation projects in the Andean country, after the expulsion of USAID. Business attache Larry Memmott said that “our economic aid has always been delivered through USAID and, at the request of the Bolivian government, it does not work in the country anymore [therefore] economic aid is no longer an issue between the two countries. We do not provide economic assistance in Bolivia at the request of the Bolivian government.” Bolivian President Evo Morales replied to Memmott’s statement saying that his country “does not need charity” and that it is the obligation of the US government to contribute, as part of a shared responsibility, on the fight against drug trafficking. Morales expelled the US aid agency on 1st May 2013, accusing it of conspiring against his government. Guatemala – Teachers’ Strike Lifted: The Guatemalan Congress approved yesterday an increase of 1.5bn quetzals in the budgets for education and health. The government had requested the budget increase, which was passed by 135 votes to two. After the news became known, teachers blocking roads around the country, including access to the capital, in demand for more resources in these areas ended their protest. The teachers’ demands also include that the funds allocated to the education budget are used to hire 5,000 teachers, increase salaries by 10%, bring back school meals, repair schools, and pay overdue bills."

"Leopoldo López (centre) gives himself up to the National Guard today (photo: AFP/ Juan Barreto/Télam)Venezuela – Opposition Leader Arrested as Protests Continue: A figurehead of the opposition protests taking place since last Wednesday in Venezuela, Leopoldo López, handed himself over to the National Guard while leading another march today in Caracas. López had been wanted by police for several days, suspected of various crimes, including inciting the violence that left three dead last week. Dressed in white and carrying flowers, López spoke to protesters gathered on the streets of the capital before giving himself up. “If my incarceration serves to awaken the people, it will be worth it,” he said. Pro-government groups also took to the streets again today in a show of support for President Nicolás Maduro, who spoke to the crowds this afternoon. Also today, the government confirmed via the Official Gazette the removal of the head of the Bolivarian National Intelligence Service (Sebin), days after confirming that members of the unit had disobeyed orders not to go out on the streets during the marches on 12th February. Gustavo González was named at the new Sebin director. Honduras – Government to Establish ‘Dry Sunday’ to Combat Crime: The government in Honduras announced yesterday that it would impose a ban on alcohol for 11 hours from Sunday afternoons in an effort to reduce violent crime and road accidents. Presidential Secretary Reinaldo Sánchez told press that the sale of alcohol would be forbidden between 5pm on Sunday until 6am on Monday and will be enforced at a national level. Honduras has one of the world’s highest murder rates, calculated by the Autonomous National University of Honduras (UNAH) at 79.7 per 100,000 people in 2013 (compared to an estimated global average of 8.8). However, director of the Violence Observatory at UNAH, Migdonia Ayestas, said more studies must be conducted to investigate the link between alcohol and homicides. “We can say that the violent murders in Honduras are usually committed on weekends. Whether this is due to the intake of alcohol requires greater investigation and analysis.” Brazil – Curitiba Confirmed as World Cup Venue: The Arena da Baixada stadium in Curitiba was today given the green light by football governing body FIFA to host matches in the 2014 World Cup starting 12th June. The venue had been in doubt due to severe delays in the construction of the stadium, and was given until today to convince FIFA that it would be ready on time. After an inspection, FIFA Secretary General Jérôme Valcke announced via Twitter this afternoon that Curitiba would remain a host city, “based on financial guarantees, the commitments by all stakeholders, and progress made.” Valcke added that: “It’s a race against a very tight timeline.” The stadium is scheduled to host four group stage matches during the tournament, with the first to be played on 15th June."

"Images of deforestation in the Chaco (Photo: Greenpeace) Paraguay – Rancher Rejects Plea from Ayoreo to Stop Chaco Deforestation: A Brazilian rancher, Marcelo Bastos Ferraz, has rejected a plea from members of the Ayoreo indigenous community to stop cutting down the Chaco forest in which they live near the Paraguay-Bolivia border. Ferraz met with Ayoreo representatives and Paraguayan Environment Secretary Cristina Molinos yesterday, less than two months after his company, Yaguarete Pora S.A, was given a licence to clear forest on its 73,000 hectares in the Chaco, despite it being within a UNESCO biosphere reserve and home to the Ayoreo. As Paraguay’s last uncontacted indigenous tribe, the Ayoreo are highly vulnerable to disease from outsiders, as well as the destruction of the forest they depend on to live. At the meeting, Molinos, who has received international criticism for not protecting the Ayoreo, said there was nothing she could do to return the land to them. Last month, a study by the University of Maryland revealed that Paraguay’s Chaco forest has the world’s highest rate of deforestation. Brazilian Cameraman Dies From Rio Protest Injuries: Television news cameraman Santiago Andrade was confirmed to have died from the head injuries he sustained during last week’s violent protests in Rio de Janeiro. Andrade was filming the protest over hikes in public transport fares when he was hit by a flare. He was declared brain dead by doctors on Monday morning, and earlier today a spokesperson for the TV station he worked at, Bandeirantes, confirmed that he had died shortly afterwards. Vice president Michel Temer today blamed the death on violent groups that he said have infiltrated recent protests, including the so-called ‘black blocs’. “I think there is an element of terrorism in these organisations,” said Temer in a press conference. “The constitution guarantees the right to protest, but not to predation. This is a crime and it must be considered as such.” Police today said they had arrested the suspected thrower of the flare. Ecuador to Open New Embassies: Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Leonardo Arízaga announced that Ecuador would be opening new embassies in five countries in Africa during 2014. The new embassies will be located in Kenya, Algeria, Angola, Nigeria, and Ethiopia, bringing the country’s total on the continent to seven, including existing embassies in Egypt and South Africa. The move is part of a plan to boost Ecuador’s strategic presence around the world. The government will also soon be opening a new embassy in Palestine, as it supports the search for a peaceful resolution to its territorial conflict."

"Flooding in San Juan (Photo: Rubén Paratore/Télam)Government Increases Support for Flood Victims: The head of the National Administration for Social Security (Anses), Diego Bossio, announced this morning that the national government would boost its support for those affected by widespread flooding in the provinces of San Juan and Mendoza. Bossio said that Anses would double its pension and social welfare payments to those affected by the floods, while subsidised loans from the social housing programme Procrear would be provided for those needing to repair their properties. Bossio added that an estimated 10,000 to 12,000 families would qualify for this additional support. Up to 3,000 people have been evacuated from their homes in San Juan in recent days due to the floods. In some areas an estimated 100mm of rain, approximately the annual average for the region, has fallen in the last week. The provincial education minister, Cristina Díaz, also announced today that the start of the school year would be delayed by two weeks until 10th March due to the impact of the floods, with many evacuees taking refuge in public schools. The National Meteorological Service (SMN) has warned that unstable conditions would persist in the region until the end of this week. Security Secretary in Favour of Decriminalising Drugs: Argentina’s national secretary for security, Segrio Berni, said that on a personal level he is in favour of “decriminalising the entire supply chain [of drugs], from production to consumption.” Speaking on radio show Tierra de Locos today, Berni added that violence associated with drug trafficking gangs was “the natural evolution of the business of illicit goods” and called for a “serious and responsible debate” on the subject. Earlier today, Cabinet Chief Jorge Capitanich affirmed Berni’s claims that Argentina is not a producer of drugs on a meaningful scale, contradicting a statement last week by Defence Minister Agustín Rossi. Both played down media rumours of a division in the ruling party over official drugs policy. Road Accident Deaths in Buenos Aires Increased in 2013: A report by the Ombudsman for Buenos Aires revealed that deaths caused by traffic accidents in the capital increased by 11.7% in 2013. The reported counted 10,124 serious accidents during the year, up 2.9% compared to 2012, causing 10,621 injuries (up 1.1%) and 86 fatalities. Almost half (39) of those that died were pedestrians, with motorcyclists and car drivers the next most vulnerable groups.

"Personal look over the wreckage at the Once station in Buenos Aires. (Photo: Beatrice Murch) Once Train Crash – Brakes in Working Order: An expert’s report on 2012′s Once train crash determined that the brakes on the train were in working order at the time of the accident. The report was carried out as per the court’s request, by three experts appointed by the court and four appointed by the train driver Marcos Córdoba, the National Commission for Transport Regulation (CNRT), the Transport Secretariat, and former operator of the Sarmiento train line TBA. “The inspected hoses were in good working order,” indicated the report. The tragedy, which occurred on 22nd February 2012, left 51 people dead and dozens injured when the train known as ‘Chapa 16′ failed to brake as it entered the Once terminal station. Lawmaker Proposes Ban on Plastic Surgery: Deputy Mara Brawer, from the governing Frente Para la Victoria (FPV) will introduce a bill in Congress on Thursday seeking to ban plastic surgery on people under the age of 18. Brawer clarified that the bill would still allow for this kind of surgery to be performed in minors if they are of the “reconstructive, sex change, and therapeutic kind. That is, if a child suffers from violence and discrimination because they’ve got a big nose and that makes their daily life difficult, then this kind of surgery would be allowed.” The deputy indicated that the reason behind the bill is to “preserve [the children's] mental and physical health,” affected by “cultural patterns” which dictate an ideal body image. In that sense, she considers that it is necessary “to limit the demands of the market” which tend to “homogenise the bodies.” Infant Mortality Hits Record Low: Infant mortality in the province of Buenos Aires hit a record low of 10.9 per 1,000 live births in 2013. The 2013 rate means a 6% decrease in infant mortality compared to the previous year, when it was 11.5, and follows a trend which has seen this rate drop for four consecutive years. In 2009, the infant mortality rate (IMR) in Buenos Aires was of 12.4, in 2010 of 12, and in 2011 of 11.7. “This is a long term decrease which makes us want to keep moving forward with the policies that permitted this trend, in an indicator that is key to measuring the population’s health,” said provincial Health Minister Alejandro Collia. The aim for 2015, according to the authorities, is to reach an IMR of one digit."

On Friday 8th February, between 2.47 and 3.02pm, the emergency service received three calls alerting them to the erratic behaviour of a lorry driver, who was seen driving recklessly, allegedly drunk and against traffick on route 7, which runs between Mendoza and Córdoba. Later, between 5.34 and 5.44, five more calls were made to 911 indicating that the same person was driving against traffic. Only a minute later, at 5.45, the truck crashed against a bus, killing 17 people and injuring 14. “According to our register, he drove against traffic on the motorway for at least ten minutes,” said Juan Carlos Caleri, General Director of the Mendoza police. Caleri also informed that all the audio and video files which registered the lorry that day were sent to the prosecutor over the weekend, “to analyse the actions of the police officers in the hours before the tragedy.” AFIP Denies Changes to Foreign Currency Purchases: In a statement released this morning, tax agency AFIP denied having made changes to the criteria used to allow purchases of foreign currencies, as reported by an article on La Nación. The purchase of foreign currency “works normally and without alterations,” says the statement, which also confirms that the conditions to allow for these purchases are set out by the Central Bank. The article published in today’s print edition of La Nación, under the headline ‘Without prior notice AFIP restricted the purchase of [US] dollars for savings‘, warned that “Without admitting it publicly, AFIP arbitrarily restricted in February the limits it applies to the purchase of [US] dollars, both for some self-employed workers and for employees, as La Nación confirmed through different savers.” Through their website www.dialogofiscal.gob.ar, AFIP informed that 330,575 operations of foreign currency purchases were registered between 27th January -when these transactions were authorised- and 7th February, for a total amount of US$176,977,706. Over 151,000 of these transactions were performed last week. Irregularities in Iron Mountain Warehouse Revealed: Edgardo Castro, an inspector at the Buenos Aires Labour Sub-secretariat, revealed that, in 2008, he closed down the warehouse that burned down last week, killing nine firefighters. “I requested for that place to be closed down because basically it had deficiencies in its fire protection system. There was too much flammable material, the hoses didn’t work, there were no sprinklers, and there were obstacles in the hallways,” said Castro. Though his request was granted and the warehouse was closed down, he was later removed from the case. Speaking to news agency Télam, Castro also said that the neighbourhood of Barracas is “like a powder keg” due to the number of buildings that do not meet basic safety requirements: “If they don’t employ capable inspectors, these things will continue to happen, on a smaller or greater scale they will continue to happen, it’s a matter of time.”"	"News From Argentina; Round Ups Argentina; accident; AFIP; dollars; fire; foreign currency; iron mountain; mendoza; negligence; police; safety"	"http://www.argentinaindependent.com/currentaffairs/newsfromargentina/argentina-news-roundup-10th-february-2014/"	"2014-02-10 21:37:04"	"2014-02-10 21:22:14"	"85"	"General"	"argentina independent"

The Yasuní-ITT initiative was a proposal by the government of Ecuador, launched in 2007 by president Rafael Correa, to refrain indefinitely from exploiting the oil reserves of the Ishpingo-Tambococha-Tiputini (ITT) block in Yasuní National Park in eastern Ecuador, in exchange for 50% of the value of the income it would be forgoing from the world community. The block consists of three oil fields which contain an estimated 846m barrels of oil, an estimated 20% of the country’s proven reserves. But in August last year President Correa announced the plan had collapsed as they had raised just US$13m of their US$3.6bn target. However, yesterday’s scandalous revelations put the government’s will to have the project succeed into question, showing the government gave drilling access to the Chinese in exchange for loans for public projects, and that their negotiations began as early as 2009. The leaked document, entitled China Development Bank Credit Proposal, states: “Last minute clause: The Ecuadorian party has said it will do all it can to help PetroChina and Andes Petroleum explore ITT and Block 31.” Atossa Soltani, a former ambassador for the project, told the Guardian: “This raises serious doubts about whether the government was truly committed to keeping ITT oil in the ground. While we were promoting the Yasuni initiative to donors, the government was offering ITT’s crude to China.” The Ecuadorian government has yet to respond to the revelations. Colombia: Campesino Reserve Zone Approved in Catatumbo: After seven months of negotiations, the Colombian government yesterday gave the green light to the creation of a Campesino Reserve Zone in Catatumbo. The zone, which will be in Tibú, north of Santander, in eastern Colombia, will be legally demarcated in March and will comprise some 115,000 hectares. A social emergency was declared in Catatumbo in August after their coca crops were destroyed as part of the US-led war on drugs. Farmers – who were compensated with two pigs, a food basket, and US$750 – were left with few resources to support their families, and started demonstrating. Their protests were violently oppressed, leading to the deaths of several farmers, and after nearly two months of protests the Colombian government set up a round table to come to an agreement. It is hoped that the creation of the reserve will pave the way for other campesino groups in other parts of the country to achieve the same. Chile: Celestino Córdova found Guilty: In a divided ruling, Mapuche indigenous leader Celestino Córdova has been found guilty of starting a deadly fire at a farm on 4th January 2013 in the Araucanía region in southern Chile. The fire led to the deaths of farmer Werner Luchsinger and his wife Vivianne Mackay. According to his lawyer, Pablo Ortega, the prosecution had no direct or indirect evidence linking the Mapuche leader to the crime – the only thing connecting him to the fire was that he was arrested close to the farm on the night of the incident. Córdova also released a statement saying that he had been taken to trial “without any evidence” against him. He went on to say his imprisonment is a “threat to the new generations” and an “empty gesture” on the part of the Chilean state. The prosecution had envoked the anti-terrorist law in the case, something his defence argued was used to put fear into the population. However, the same tribunal absolved Córdova of terrorism charges. The prosecution have asked that he be sentenced to life imprisonment. Córdova’s sentencing will take place on 28th February at 4pm."

Texaco, which has since been taken over by Chevron, spilled 18bn gallons of toxic waste water into the rainforest, as well as 17m gallons of oil in “cost-cutting measures”. However, despite an Ecuadorian court ordering the oil giant to pay US$19bn in damages (since reduced to US$9.5bn, when the ruling was upheld by an appeals court), the money for the clean up has never appeared, and the corporation instead took the indigenous communities and their legal team to court in New York, something many called a “show trial“. On Tuesday, Judge Lewis Kaplan ruled in favour of Chevron, something observers had predicted would happen, given the judge’s sympathies for the oil giant. After the latest ruling, the corporation has been absolved of wrongdoing and does not have to pay damages to clean up the rainforest. Lawyers for the indigenous communities have said they will appeal the ruling in higher US courts. Venezuela Breaks Ties with Panama: Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, yesterday announced the breaking of diplomatic and trade ties with Panama, during acts to commemorate the first anniversary of the death of former president Hugo Chávez. “We will not allow anybody to mess with impunity in our national affairs,” said Maduro, who then referred to Panama’s leader, Ricardo Martinelli, as a “grovelling lackey”. Martinelli had convened the Permanent Council of the Organisation of American States (OAS) to consider the Venezuelan crisis, which has seen violent demonstrations lead to almost 20 deaths over the last three weeks. Martinelli seemed surprised by the decision, writing on Twitter “Panama only desires that our brother country finds peace and strengthens its democracy.” Venezuela’s government sees the OAS as an organisation run from Washington, and does not actively participate in the group in protest of the suspension of Cuba. Along with other Latin American nations, the country pushed for the formation of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) in 2010 as a response to the OAS. Meanwhile, Venezuela has asked the presidential council of Unasur to convene to consider the country’s current turbulence. Chilean Mapuche Leader Sentenced to 18 Years in Prison: Mapuche indigenous leader Celestino Córdova has been sentenced to 18 years in prison after being found guilty of starting a deadly fire at a farm on 4th January 2013 in the Araucanía region in southern Chile.

According to his legal team, he will appeal the ruling and sentence, as the prosecution had no direct or indirect evidence linking the Mapuche leader to the crime – the only thing connecting him to the fire was that he was arrested close to the farm on the night of the incident. Córdova also released a statement saying that he had been taken to trial “without any evidence” against him.

"The former Repsol-YPF tower in Puerto Madero (photo: Wikipedia) Repsol Agrees To US$5bn Settlement With Government Over YPF Takeover: The board of directors at Spanish oil company Repsol today accepted a US$5bn compensation from the government for the expropriation of its assets in Argentina following the nationalisation of YPF in 2012. According to a Repsol press release, the settlement consists of a fixed package of three types of sovereign bonds with a nominal value of US$5bn, and a complementary package of three other bonds worth a maximum of US$1bn, to cover any discounts in the market value of the first package. The agreement will only be finalised after it is approved by Repsol shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in March, and ratified by the Argentine Congress. As part of the settlement, which is around half the US$10.5bn originally demanded by Repsol, the company will drop all legal action brought against Argentina. Murder and Tension After New Villa Lugano Occupation: A man was killed in a dispute last night as around 200 people occupied a piece of land near the Parque Indoamericano in the neigbourhood of Villa Lugano. Osvaldo Soto, 30, was shot as families marked out informal lots in a police vehicle impound on the outskirts of the Villa 20, in the south-western corner of Buenos Aires. The settlers are demanding land to build property, claiming the city government has failed to deliver on promises of social housing. Secretary of Security Sergio Berni met with representatives of the settlers today, but no agreement has been reached yet. Berni criticised Buenos Aires public prosecutor Carlos Rolero for not responding to calls last night or ordering police to evacuate the police property before more people moved in. Rolero said later that he was seeking a peaceful resolution, and said that the Metropolitan Police has not been given an order to remove the settlers by force. In December 2010, around 5,000 informal settlers occupied the Parque Indoamericano for several days, leading to a stand off between Federal and Metropolitan police forces and violent clashes that left three dead. Construction Worker Killed in Building Collapse: The collapse of a building site in the Buenos Aires neighbourhood of Balvanera this morning killed one construction worker and injured another four. The construction workers’ union UOCRA said in a statement that the building site had been reported to the city government on 12th February for “multiple breaches” of work safety regulations. “Unfortunately, the lack of responsibility by the business and lack of action by the controlling authorities, in spite of warnings by UOCRA, have once again combined to take the life of workers,” said the union."

"Buses waiting at the Retiro terminal (photo: Beatrice Murch) Bus Drivers Go on Strike: Long distance bus drivers have announced a 72-hour strike from midnight. They are demanding a $2,000 payment before the start of collective wage negotiations. Mario Calegari, press secretary at transport workers’ union UTA, said that the workers “are willing to negotiate” but have not received any offers so far. In a press conference yesterday, Interior and Transport Minister Florencio Randazzo said that the government “has had meetings with the head of UTA, Roberto Fernández” and with representatives of the bus companies in search of an agreement. The strike comes on a busy weekend, as many holiday makers return to their homes on the last weekend of January and many others, who take their holidays on the first fortnight of February, leave for the tourist resorts. Central Market Vice-president Promises Lower Prices: The new Vice-President of the Central Market Corporation, Alberto Samid, announced that they will open up shops and set up itinerant markets in the province of Buenos Aires which will sell fruits and vegetables at prices “up to 50% cheaper than at supermarkets.” The idea, according to Samid is “to bring the Central Market out to the streets so that people can buy goods straight from the producers, so that there’s no inflation, but deflation.” Samid, who owns a chain of butchers’ shops, also predicted that beef prices, which were affected by a drop in the number of livestock, will go down: “It always goes up by 20% and then goes down 10 or 5%” The Central Market, located in the Buenos Aires district of La Matanza, acts as a wholesale distributor of fruits and vegetables and is under the control of the Domestic Trade Secretariat. Government Criticises ‘Speculators’: Chief of Cabinet Jorge Capitanich accused large agricultural producers who do not sell their grain of being “greedy” and “speculative”. Those who avoid exporting their crops and bringing the resulting foreign currency into the country, said the minister, affect “savings and investment” which in turn produces “less investment and fewer jobs.” He also claimed that the government is “completely on its own, fighting against powerful economic groups” which put prices up, causing “inconveniences for consumers.” Representatives of the main agricultural organisations replied to Capitanich, saying that “the few producers who still have grains to sell are being prudent, not greedy, in a market where all their costs are tied up to the price of a future [US] dollar which they do not know and in a situation of inflation of over 30% annually.” Pedro Apaolaza, vice-president of Argentine Rural Confederations (CRA), added: “We are going to sell whenever we see fit, because this is a free country.” Luciano Arruga: Today marks the fifth anniversary of the disappearance of Luciano Arruga. A 16-year old from Lomas del Mirador, La Matanza, Arruga was last seen on the night of 31st January 2009 when a police car picked him up from the street as he was walking home. Witnesses have reported that the police brutally beat him up and took him to the police station. His family has been fighting to bring the suspects -eight police officers- before justice, but so far no one has been prosecuted. Human Rights Secretary Martín Fresneda said: “As long as Luciano Arruga is missing there is a pending moral debt. Therefore, it is fundamental that the national, provincial, and municipal state reaffirm that responsibility from all three levels: executive, legislative, and judicial.”"	"News From Argentina; Round Ups Argentina; bus drivers; campo; central market; dollars; food prices; Jorge Capitanich; Luciano Arruga; Speculation; strike"	"http://www.argentinaindependent.com/currentaffairs/newsfromargentina/argentina-news-roundup-31st-january-2014/"	"2014-01-31 23:29:45"	"2014-01-31 22:34:49"	"85"	"General"	"argentina independent"

"Jean-Claude “Baby Doc” Duvalier, in 1975. Haiti – Ex Dictator Could Face Human Rights Trial: An appeals court in Haiti has ruled that the former dictator Jean Claude Duvalier can face trial for alleged human rights abuses between 1971 and 1986. The court overruled the decision in 2012 by first instance judge Jean Carves that the time in which Duvalier could be prosecuted for human rights crimes had expired, and ordered an investigation to determine whether a new trial should be called. The verdict ruled that under international law, crimes against humanity are excluded from statute of limitations. Duvalier, nicknamed ‘Baby Doc’, also faces charges of corruption, theft and embezzlement; he has denied all charges brought against him. During Duvalier’s 15-year rule, thousands of Haitian civilians were murdered, tortured, or disappeared. He was forced into exile for 25 years after a popular revolt in 1986, but returned to Haiti in 2011. Brazil Calls In Army To Beef Up World Cup Security: Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff announced that the army will be called on “if necessary” to control street protests during the 2014 World Cup. “Brazil is ready to guarantee the safety of its citizens and visitors,” declared Rousseff as she unveiled a R$1.9bn (reais) security programme for the tournament. Civil, Federal, and Military Police forces will also coordinate security programmes in the 12 host cities. The announcement comes soon after the death of a Brazilian cameraman who was hit by a flare during violent protests in Rio de Janeiro, the latest in a series of demonstrations that began in July 2013. Venezuela – Government Revokes Credentials for CNN Journalists: CNN International and CNN en Español confirmed today that the Venezuelan authorities had revoked the press credentials of seven journalists working in the country. The notification came hours after President Nicolas Maduro criticised the media channel for its coverage of recent protests. “They want to show the world that there is a civil war in Venezuela,” said Maduro yesterday evening. “Enough war propaganda! If you do not rectify things, get out of Venezuela, CNN!” The decision came during another day of protests in cities around the country by opposition group Voluntad Popular, led by Leopoldo López, who was arrested on Tuesday. Last night, prosecutors dropped charges of murder and terrorism against López, though he will remain in custody while other charges – including arson, inciting violence, and damage to public property – are investigated."

"  Climate action at Rio+20 UN talks in Rio de Janerio, Brazil in 2012. (Photo: Oxfam Scotland by Colin Hattersley Photography) Latin America: 2014 Climate Legislation Study Released: Today, the Global Legislators Organisation (GLOBE International) released the 4th edition of the Climate Legislation Study – produced in partnership with the Grantham Research Institute at the London School of Economics. The Study is a comprehensive audit of climate legislation across 66 countries, together responsible for around 88% of global manmade greenhouse gas emissions. This includes the following Latin American countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Guyana, Mexico, Peru, and Venezuela. Of the above, Mexico and Bolivia stood out as having made the most progress on Climate Change legislation during 2013. Mexico, following up on its 2012 General Law on Climate Change, announced the creation of the Climate Change National System and the Inter-secretarial Committee on Climate Change. It also adopted the National Climate Change Strategy. This strategy sets out the main focal areas regarding cross-sectoral climate policy, adaptation to climate change and reduction of GHG emissions, and reinforces Mexico’s GHG mitigation targets. In October 2012 Bolivia passed The Mother Earth Law and Integral Development to Live Well, Law No 300 of 2012. The law is a sweeping overhaul of the national management of natural resources, climate, and ecosystem. Peru and Colombia: No More Visas for EU Travel: The European Parliament today voted to allow visa-free travel for citizens of Peru and Colombia to countries in the Schengen Area in Europe. The vote came during a meeting held today in Strasbourg, where a 523 out of 577 EU representatives voted in favour of the measure. The decision means citizens of both countries will no longer require a visa for short stays (up to 90 days) in the Schengen area, whether for tourism or business purposes. The elimination of the visa requirement for both countries’ nationals was proposed last August by Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy. The Schengen Area comprises 22 of the 28 countries of the European Union: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden, along with non-members Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland. Amazon Deforestation Outside of Brazil Remains High:  According to a report by Terra-i, deforestation in the Amazon continues to grow a high rate in eight of the nine countries that the rainforest covers. The study shows whilst in Brazil – which contains 60% of the rainforest – deforestation has dropped from 2.7m hectares in 2004 to 465,000 hectares in 2012; in the other eight countries, 2.3m hectares of forest razed between 2004 and 2012. The countries included are: Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, French Guiana, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela. The majority of the deforestation occurs as the agricultural frontier in the countries expands; with land used either for grazing or for planting of crops. The rainforest’s expensive woods are also sought after, mostly for export."

After more rounds of negotiations over the holiday weekend, the five main teachers’ unions rejected a revised offer from the national government of a 31% salary hike spread over the coming 16 months, plus additional payments based on attendance. The leader of the Argentine Confederation of Educational Workers (Ctera), Stella Maldonado, called the offer “insufficient”, and confirmed the strike would go ahead, despite the government calling for a mandatory conciliation. “We expect the strike will be adhered to fully, even in the five provinces that have reached an agreement,” said Maldonado. Negotiations over teachers’ wages at the national level are designed to set a standard minimum level that each province must respect when reaching an agreement within their jurisdiction. Femicide Report: One Woman Killed Every 30 Hours: According to a report published today by Casa del Encuentro, 295 women were killed in gender violence attacks during 2013, averaging one death every 30 hours, the highest rate in the last six years. Of the total, 83 women were shot dead, 64 stabbed to death, 37 beaten to death, and 28 died after being strangled. In 38% of the cases, the killers were husbands, boyfriends, partners or lovers of the victim. The majority of the women were aged between 19 and 30 at the time of their death, although a large number were also aged between 31 and 50. The crimes mostly took place in the victim’s home, or the home she shared with the killer. In 46 cases, the woman had already reported gender violence at the hands of her eventual murderer. Of the total, 11 women were pregnant at the time of their deaths, and a further 27 were sexually abused before being killed. As a result of the killings, some 400 children were left without a mother. 1765 Shipwreck Found in Tierra del Fuego: A group of researchers has found the remains of ‘La Purísima Concepción’, a Spanish ship that sank in 1765, on the shores of the island. The expedition, which was searching the Mitre Peninsula on horseback, found fragments of wood, metal, ceramics and glass, as well as the ship’s cannon balls, according to Dolores Elkin, the head of the Subaquatic Archeology Programme from the National Institute of Latin American Anthropology and Thought. Purísima Concepción left Cádiz port in 1764 with 193 people on board, and after sinking in the region of Caleta Falsa in January 1765, the crew stayed on Tierra del Fuego for three months, living alongside the indigenous population. The sailors managed to build another ship with parts of their sunken vessel, and sailed on to safety before winter arrived. The archeologists found the remains of a further 12 shipwrecks and some 400 archeological sites linked to the native populations of the island. They were revising 200km of Tierra del Fuego’s coastline, from south of the city of Río Grande to San Diego Cape."

"El Salvadorian presidential candidate Salvador Sánchez Cerén (photo courtesy of Wikipedia). El Salvador Presidential run-off too Close to Call:  With 100% of the votes counted, neither candidate has been declared the winner of yesterday’s presidential election run-off in El Salvador. Preliminary counts indicate that current vice president Salvador Sánchez Cerén from the governing left-wing FMLN party received 50.11% of the votes, whilst conservative Norman Quijano from the Nationalist Republican Alliance, ARENA, took 49.89%. However, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal has asked that neither candidate declare themselves the winner as the difference is so close that it is within the margin of error, and so they must wait for the results of the final count, which will likely come in on Wednesday or Thursday. The winner will take power on 1st June and will govern the country for the next five years. Colombia Legislative Elections: With a turnout of just 35-40%, yesterday’s legislative elections in Colombia have dramatically re-drawn the country’s political map. President Juan Manuel Santos’ Partido de la U lost its majority in the senate, winning just 21 of the 102 seats, and 37 of the 166 seats in the house of representatives. Overall, the party is still the most powerful, although it will have to continue working in coalition with allies to keep governing the country when the new congress takes power in July. Former president Alvaro Uribe won a seat in the country’s senate, the first time a former leader has run for a seat in the country’s congress, and his newly-formed party Centro Democrático managed to win 19 seats in the senate and 18 in the house of representatives, on a platform that went against the on-going peace talks with FARC. The new congress will sit for a period of four years, and will play a decisive role in the implementation of the peace accords, which aim to put an end to the armed conflict, which has blighted the country for 50 years. The results come just over two months before the country sees presidential elections, which are set to take place on 25th May, and will see Santos run for re-election. Mexico Caballeros Templarios Leader Killed: Mexican authorities have confirmed they have killed Nazario Moreno, leader of the Caballeros Templarios cartel, in a violent operation involving police and soliders in Tumbiscatío, Michoacán. Forty-three year old Moreno, known as ‘El Más Loco’, or the ‘Most Crazy’, was originally declared dead in December 2010 by former president Felipe Calderón’s government, but a body was never found and intelligence showed that he was still actively involved in the cartel’s operations. The Caballeros Templarios are known for their brutality and use of religious imagery, and run much of the methamphetamine production and trafficking in the west of Mexico. The news comes days after militia in the state of Michoacán agreed to a “gradual demobilisation” due to the presence of federal security forces. Militias were formed in Michoacán as a way to protect the population from the criminal activities of drug cartels."

"Secretary General of the metal workers’ union and the CGT, Antonio Caló, and of the taxi drivers’ union, Omar Viviani (photo: Paula Ribas/Télam/ef) President Meets with Unions Ahead of Wage Negotiations: President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner met with union leaders yesterday in order to discuss the upcoming collective wage negotiations for 2014. The meeting took place at the presidential residence in Olivos at 6pm, and was attended by representatives from the metal workers, taxi drivers, water workers, and mechanics unions, all of which belong to the faction of the General Workers’ Confederation (CGT) that is closest to the government. It has been reported that, during the meeting, the President requested “moderation, prudence, and intelligence” when negotiating wages for this year. Whilst the government did not specify a maximum percentage for wage increases, they expect that they will not go up by more than 25%, in order to keep inflation in check. It was also agreed that collective wage negotiations will continue to take place annually, and, as per the unionists’ request, the President committed to analysing the possibility of increasing the minimum wage. The meeting comes amidst concerns about the potential impact of wage negotiations on inflation levels. Both parties considered it “positive”. Metropolitan Train Lines To Be Privately Operated: The government transferred the operation of four metropolitan train lines to private companies Metrovías and Ferrovías. The Mitre, San Martín, Roca, and Belgrano Sur lines were, until today, operated by two consortiums -Ugoms and Ugofe- formed by these companies and the national state. Resolution 41/2014, published today in the Official Gazette, indicates that “it is necessary to adjust the operational agreements” for these train lines, “with the aim of establishing clear rules and strengthen the operators’ control and responsibility.” Interior and Transport Minister Florencio Randazzo informed that the companies will be subject to strict sanctions of to up $220,000 in fines (the equivalent of 200,000 tickets) if there were delays, cancelled services, interruptions, fewer cars on peak hour, or lack of maintenance in cars and stations. Operators will also be required to submit “annual plans regarding train frequencies, maintenance, cleanliness, and quality of the service” which will be subject to monthly controls, said Randazzo. The Sarmiento train line will continue to be operated by the state. Ex-President Menem Acquitted on Military Factory Explosion Case: Former President Carlos Menem was acquitted today on the case investigating the explosion of a military factory in Río Tercero, Córdoba, which took place in 1995 and in which seven people died. The ruling, delivered by a court of appeals in Córdoba, overturns the decision of the judge of first instance, who had prosecuted Menem. Former Army general Martín Balza was also acquitted. The complainant’s lawyer, Ricardo Monner Sans, announced this afternoon that the ruling will be appealed. Last year, Menem was sentenced to seven years in prison over illegal arms sales to Croatia and Ecuador. The prosecutor claims the explosion at the Río Tercero military factory was intentional, and intended to cover up the illegal arms operations. Protests in Once over Eviction of Street Sellers: Seven people were arrested today as protests broke out in Once during a police operation to remove street sellers. The sellers were arrested by the Metropolitan Police, in charge of the operation, for “aggression and resisting authority”. Afterwards, a group of protesters blocked the corner of Av. Corrientes and Av. Pueyrredón, demanding the arrested be released, however they freed up the street after 4pm."

The summit saw Sebastián Piñera of Chile, Colombia’s Juan Manuel de Santos, José Peña Nieto of Mexico, and Ollanta Humala of Peru sign a trade deal which will free 92% of the countries’ products from duties as soon as it comes into force, with a further 7% to be liberated in the medium term. The only product set to retain trade duties into the longer term is sugar. It is thought the pact – which has been criticised by other Latin American countries as well as civil society and social movements within the member states – will come into force next year. The four nations, with a total population of 212m, have a combined GDP of US$2bn and represent 50% of all trade in Latin America. Costa Rican president Laura Chinchilla is also attending the summit to underline her country’s interest in joining the trade bloc. Costa Rica currently holds observer status in the Alliance’s summits, along with Panama. Mexican Milita and Army Take Cartel’s Stronghold: Groups of armed milita, supported by the Mexican army and federal police, have taken the centre of the city of Apatzingán, in south Michoacán, a place considered to be a bastion of the Caballero Templarios cartel. They have set up roadblocks on seven of the town’s access routes and are going from door to door to find members of the criminal drug network. The militia have said they will remain in the city, Michoacán’s third largest, on a permanent basis to keep the peace. After government attempts to disband the groups of armed civilians ended violently, two weeks ago an agreement was reached with the militia, temporarily legalising them and incorporating them as civilian guards. The militia originally formed two years ago in response to extortions and killings by the Templarios. They have been actively fighting the cartel for a year. Brazil’s Landless Workers’ Movement Opens 6th National Congress: The Landless Workers’ Movement (MST) opened its 6th National Congress today in Brasilia, with 15,000 campesinos and 250 international guests set to attend the five-day conference in the Brazilian capital. The theme of the conference is ‘Fight, Construct Agrarian Reform’ for the MST’s 1.5m members. The MST was created on 22nd January 1984 in a national meeting that brought together 80 rural workers in Cascavel, Parana. The movement now has presence in 23 of Brazil’s 26 states, where members produce organic food, implement agricultural businesses in the form of cooperatives, and work to increase the income of rural workers. Over the years the MST has also carried out more than 2,500 occupations, and set up 2,000 schools in settlements, as well lobbying for agrarian reform on a national level."

Survival International, an NGO that works for the rights of tribal peoples, shares images of life with the Awá."	"The Awá of Brazil’s eastern Amazon are considered by Survival International, a human rights organisation which campaigns for the rights of indigenous tribal peoples, to be the world’s most threatened tribe. Despite their land being demarcated in 2003, hundreds of members of the tribe have been killed, either by disease or by settlers, and only around 350 Awá remain, 100 of whom have no contact with the outside world. However, in a victory for campaigners, last month a government operation began to evict illegal settlers, ranchers, and loggers from the land of the Awá. Soldiers, field workers from Brazil’s indigenous affairs department FUNAI, environment ministry special agents, and police officers were dispatched in the operation, that comes at a crucial time, as loggers are said to have been closing in on the tribe, and more than 30% of their forest has already been destroyed.

"332374"	"Torres del Paine: In Search of the Patagonian King"	"Delfina Krusemann joins Tierra Patagonia's photo safari in Torres del Paine, capturing breathtaking landscapes and hoping for a glimpse of the elusive puma."	"“Getting to see a puma is a matter of luck,” says Pía Vergara as our van drives through a dusty road in Torres del Paine National Park, a million acres of wild Patagonian land at the southern tip of Chile. “Most park rangers have been living here for many years and have never encountered one, yet there is the case of a family of tourists who came here for one day only and they could not believe their eyes when a cougar and her cubs walked right in front of their car… They are really no guarantees, no formulas. We will be very lucky if we actually encounter one,” Pía continues. She’s being modest. After all, she is one of Chile’s most experienced photographers when it comes to Patagonia’s many wonders. From estancias and gauchos, glaciers and steppes, huemules and condors, and even the mythical wild horses known as baguales… she’s seen it all – and she’s captured them all through her lens, too. Even the elusive puma, the ‘Patagonian king’, which she knows how to track down in these southernmost lands. Yes, that’s right: Pía is a puma tracker and, after seeing some of her pictures, she truly deserves that impressive title in her CV. And now she’s our guide in Tierra Patagonia Hotel’s photo safari. One of Chilean photographer Pía Vergara’s closest encounters with a puma For four days, we will be taken to the most outstanding sites in the park, learning how to shoot (with the camera, that is) both landscapes and animals. It’s a full, exquisite menu of options that we get to sample: snow peaks and glaciers, rivers and valleys, lakes and rocks; sheep, foxes, crows, cows, condors, guanacos, huemules, armadillos, rheas, owls, flamingos, swans… However, all of our expectations are focused on the enigmatic mountain lion. Historically persecuted and killed by both estancieros and gauchos – despite the laws that should prevent this from happening – during the last decade tourism has brought a new, cleaner reputation to this outstanding specimen, the second-biggest cat in the continent after the jaguar. It’s too early to know if we will actually have a chance with the puma at Torres del Paine, but surely luck has been on our side when it comes to accommodation. Located inside the park – on the shore of Lake Sarmiento, with a privileged view of the Paine massif – Tierra Patagonia Hotel opened in 2010. Combining world-class service with sustainability, the building’s design concept is remarkable. “The form seeks to merge with the metaphysical landscape, not to interrupt it. The building is as though born out of the land, like a fold in the terrain that the wind has carved in the sand…”: this is one of those rare occasions in which a brochure is telling the truth. Tierra Patagonia’s chameleonic structure, made out of stone slopes and lenga wood panels, is almost impossible to spot from a fair distance. Once inside, it is cosy and homely, yet luxurious. A photo safari participant, taking in the granite towers, whilst the Tierra Patagonia hotel blends into the landscape (photo: Pía Vergara) Despite the temptation, we won’t be spending too much time at the hotel. The real beauty is outside, Pía reminds us. And so day one starts at dawn with a short hike to a cliff close to Lago Sarmiento, where we will have our first photography incursion. Sunrise is the perfect moment to explore the ever changing light, and learn how to use it to our favour with our cameras. The awakening of the Torres del Paine, the park’s top attraction, is a spectacle not to be missed. These granite towers are not part of the Andes: while the famous South American range is 65m years old, the Paine mountains are only 12 (million), which makes them the youngest in the world. Looking at their silver, clean cut peaks, it is impossible not to feel the rock is alive, with a sheer determination to stab the sky. It’s an overwhelming statement of nature’s creative process, unbeatable both in beauty and power. After breakfast back at the hotel, a van takes us to Estancia Lazo, the starting point for a six hour trek through Laguna Verde and the Magellanic forest, with its hypnotic native trees, the ñirre and the lenga, and frozen lagoons. The climate does not look encouraging for such a journey, as the tranquil dawn has turned into a wet and windy morning. “In Patagonia, betting on the weather is the worst possible deal,” asserts Pía. However, bad conditions won’t intimidate us. With our cameras at hand, we are ready to go, all senses alert to discover any sign that could lead us to the puma. I admit I am starting to have second thoughts about the whole expedition. A close encounter with a cougar right now seems nothing but terrifying. Even Pía admits her face-to-face experiences were as unnerving as magical: “I got to be only two metres away from one. My impulse was to run away, but I knew had to stand still: if you try to escape, the animal will regard you as prey. So we both stared at each other for some seconds and eventually, the puma walked away. It was incredible,” she recounts. The trek is tough but rewarding. We do not meet a puma, but we do get spectacular sights of the Paine Horns and we practise zooming in and out with our cameras thanks to a magnificent owl up in a distant tree. Looking at us with its poignant and stern eyes, he is the judge and jury of the forest, and witness to the many secrets of the wildlife within it. First photography lesson: sunrise at Lago Sarmiento, with the stunning Torres del Paine massif in the background (photo: Pía Vergara) Day two is another brisk one, and the excursion planned only reminds us to bring our warmest clothes: a boat ride to Glacier Grey. The road to the lake boasts a picturesque guanaco parade. Along with the estancia‘s sheep, guanacos are the puma’s main meal; they may also get a hare occasionally but, as Pía reminds us, these jackrabbits are only a snack for a 60kg beast. Pumas hunt at night since, like all felines, they have enhanced vision in the dark. Moreover, it is sleepy time for guanacos, and so they are easier to catch. One guanaco means three days of food, and so the pumas bury and hide the leftovers each day in order to come back the next night – at the same time keeping their treasure away from foxes and condors. After crossing the Weber Bridge, we finally get to the port at Grey Lake. The intense mist and the raindrops that cling to the tree branches make a fabulous setting for what is about to come: a white, silver and blue ice extravaganza floating away in the most surreal shapes. In what could be a moving Dalí painting, Pía takes shot after shot, encouraging us to do the same. She’s been coming to this same glacier for almost ten years, and says she’s never seen ice floes like today. Surreal shapes and reflections in Grey Lake, an ice extravaganza (photo: Pía Vergara) We then take a different road back to the hotel. The general excitement fades away when we get to one of the areas that was burnt by an Israeli tourist in 2011: because of a (forbidden) bonfire, 45,000 acres of native trees are now ashen skeletons, exposing their pain with atrocious nudity. In 2005, a Czech tourist accidentally burnt another 37,000 acres while trying to cook. Imagining such extensions of land under fire and black with smoke gives me goosebumps. This tree cemetery is the saddest, bluntest punishment; we make the rest of the journey in silence. At last, day three begins with a blue sky. The park’s colours are more vibrant and spectacular than ever, as is the wildlife on show. Already heading to Laguna Azul, our plan changes abruptly when we get good news from the park guides: with the rain over, condors are drying up their wings with a flight so graceful that it could surely qualify as bird ballet. And so we turn our direction to Estancia Las Cornisas, at Cerro Guido, which has the most similar scenery to The Lion King’s opening scene I have ever seen. This is the home of “las condoreras”, the condors’ nests. At one point, we have over 13 black birds flying in circles above our heads at the same time. The click click click of our cameras is nonstop. However, condors are not the only birds to give us a photographic feast: laicos, ducks, Coscorova swans and many more group around the puddles and ponds that the rain has left behind, as water mirrors that will soon evaporate, in the Sierra Bagual area. When asked about the name of the hill, Pía unfolds the incredible story of the baguales. These are herds of wild horses that live throughout Patagonia, hidden in remote steppes or inaccessible forests. They were once owned by estancieros, but for different reasons were set free and now they are almost a legend. “But I have seen them. The first time I did, I could not help to cry. I had travelled so many times searching for them, putting so much effort on my quest,” Pía explains. Baguales have no contact with humans; as soon as they smell us, they run away, dragging behind them a two-metre tail. To most Chileans, even locals, baguales are nothing but a mysterious legend; forever-moving shadows. The sunsets in Torres del Paine always deliver great shots. Here, a guanaco, the puma’s main meal. (photo: Pía Vergara) That night, the group is both satisfied and anxious. We have seen many wonderful things, yet no signs of a puma. And so Pía decides to take “extreme measures”. Because our chances to see one are better at night, she invites us on a nocturnal expedition that will start… at 4am. At this point, many of the group decide they have had enough adventures for one more photo safari. It’s just me and two other fellow travellers who decide to join Pía in such an endeavour. Waking up so early and leaving the comfy five-star hotel bed is the difficult part, and it does not help that is freezing outside, or that we have to keep the 4WD’s windows down in order to sweep the terrain with huge lamps. All animals have their eyes reflected in our light beams – the foxes’ are orange or red, guanacos’ are green – but alas, we are looking for a pair of yellowish eyes. After an hour, we stop to have some hot coffee while Sergio, our driver, tells us stories about UFO activity and the fabled ‘luz mala’ (evil light). Back on the road, I get to use one of the lamps. I instantly become a different person: my desire to sleep is replaced with a rigid alertness. I am focused. With half of my body out of the vehicle, my senses are fully aware. Not even a little bit of rain can discourage me from my task. Suddenly, a pair of eyes in the distance. Are they red or yellow? Sergio stops the car. The eyes disappear. Then reappear, some metres away from the first spot. With every blink, the wait becomes more desperate until we are able to see them again. It is impossible to find out what is behind those two dots of light; all the space around them is pure, infinite darkness. We spend at least half an hour following these eyes. Many times, we believe we have lost them, but then a short twinkle reignites our faith. We barely talk. All dialogue becomes whispers. Even Pía is puzzled: is it a fox or a puma? The colour looks more greenish than orange, and yet the movements seem so feline… It’s been several minutes now since we last saw those intriguing eyes blink, so Pía makes the tough call to move on. Just a few metres later, she screams: “Puma!!!” Was it a coincidence or her instinct? Either way, there it is: the mountain lion in all its splendour, walking seductively just 30 metres away from our car. It is still too dark to get a good picture, and the flash could scare it away, so we just stare at what seems a vision. It is a strange one. It seems as if the puma is staring at us, but truly he is not: there is not one hint of curiosity in his eyes. I then realise that the animal is actually piercing us with his gaze, as if we were transparent, as if there was nothing he could learn or gain from us. Here in the wild steppe, he is a superior being and he could not be less interested in a bunch of nosy humans. The car engine stops. The cougar startles and walks faster until reaching the shore of the lake, where we can’t see it anymore. We then wait until sunrise to get out of the car and go look for it on foot. I am not scared this time, only thrilled. Totally mesmerised. Under a red, drowsy sky, we look for fresh paw prints, but soon they vanish and we can’t find any other trace. Everything suddenly looks so different in daylight. The encounter now feels like a dream, distant and wondrous. Pumas are most probably seen at night. Before dawn, under a red, drowsy sky, the travellers look for fresh paw prints. (photo: Pía Vergara). The morning cold seeps into our bodies and eventually it is time to go back to the hotel for breakfast. During the journey, I reflect upon this particular kind of safari. It has nothing to do with the traditional hunting style. This time, man humbly puts himself under the animal’s will, to its movements and times of being. You can let minutes (even hours) go by for that one click that makes it all worthwhile. However, there is something else behind that one-off instant shot, more than just an image printed onto the lens. There is the animal’s soul, its character and its very being that is imprinted into the photographer’s soul. That is a feeling no camera can capture, but stays with us forever. Even if the mystery behind the very same creature remains unveiled. Tierra Patagonia Hotel & Spa’s photo safari offers a six-day programme with Pía Vergara as exclusive guide. It includes transfers, all meals and open bar, use of the spa, and all photo safari services. From US$4,700 per person, based on a shared standard room.

"Foreign Affairs Minister Elías Jaua speaking today in Caracas (photo: AVN/Télam) Venezuela Expels US Diplomats as Unrest Continues: The Venezuelan government has expelled three US embassy diplomats after accusing them of inciting the violent protests that have gripped the country since last week. Foreign Affairs minister Elías Jaua confirmed that the three unnamed diplomats had 48 hours to leave the country in a press conference in which he detailed evidence showing links between the embassy workers and various university groups. “We have proof that the embassy has been organising and encouraging violent groups from within universities,” said Jaua, citing e-mail correspondence between the US embassy in Caracas and the US State Department between 2009 and 2012. The US State Department said the claims were “false and unjust”. Meanwhile, after a weekend of further unrest, opposition leader Leopoldo López has called for another protest march in Caracas tomorrow. In a video message, López, who is wanted by police, said he would personally lead the march and take a series of demands to the Interior and Justice Ministry. “I’ll be there to show my face. I have nothing to fear, I’ve not committed any crime,” said López. “If there is a decision to illegally detain me, then I’ll be there to accept this persecution by the government.” Member states of regional bloc Mercosur issued a joint statement condemning the recent violence in Venezuela, which it said was “a strike against democracy and its institutions, regardless of who is behind it.” Panama – Indigenous Communities Face Forced Eviction: The indigenous Ngäbe-Buglé communities living on the banks of Panama’s Tabasará river are on alert today for an imminent eviction by authorities to make way for a new hydroelectric dam. A resolution by the Public Service Authority (ASEP) gave the communities until 10am today to evacuate the area for work to begin on the Barro Blanco dam. So far, the communities have resisted the order, rejected compensation payments, and blocked access routes in protest, supported by several environmental and social groups. Representatives of the company behind the project, Genisa, said that the dam would have a minimal impact on the local environment. However, a 2012 assessment report by the UN Development Programme (UNDP) concluded that it would flood homes, land and cultural sites on Ngäbe territory, as well as altering the river’s ecosystem. Corruption Scandal Rocks Colombian Army: The government has pledged to act swiftly against an alleged web of corruption at the highest levels of the Colombian army. The scandal was revealed on Sunday by investigative magazine Semana, which claimed to have hundreds of hours of recordings that implicated several army generals and many other senior officers in rigged contracts and illicit payments to army members convicted of so-called ‘false positive’ killings. Defence Minister Juan Carlos Pinzón announced today the creation of a High Level Commission to investigate the allegations, adding that some of the military contracts under suspicion would be temporarily handled by the Defence Ministry.

"389431"	"Latin America News Roundup: 13th February 2014"	"Today's news from around the region: Tension in Venezuela after 3 killed in clashes; 2014 Press Freedom Index released; Salvadorian castaway returns home"	"Opposition protests ended in violence in Venezuela (photo: AVN/Télam/ddc) Venezuela: Tension after Three Killed in Clashes: Three were killed and dozens injured in anti-government marches around Venezuela yesterday. Various groups, including thousands of students in celebration of Youth Day, took to the streets in demonstrations that started peacefully, but turned violent, leading to over 70 arrests. President Nicolas Maduro alikened the uprising to a coup attempt against his government, saying: “We are facing a planned coup against democracy and the government.” He then called on Venezuelans to reject the violence, and called on them to unite against the fascist elements who wanted to fill the country with intolerance and hatred. An arrest warrant is now out for opposition leader Leopoldo López, who the government accuses of instigating the violence. López, former mayor of Chacao, has not been able to participate actively in politics since 2008 when he faced charges of corruption. He remains a key figure in the government’s opposition. Adding to the situation, Colombian news channel NTN24, which is highly critical of Maduro’s administration, was removed from the airwaves on Wednesday after the government accused it of “promoting violence”. Calm has now returned to the streets of Caracas, and cities around the country, after the government drafted in the army to reinforce the security services, although various pro-government groups are calling for rallies in support of Maduro. Latin America: 2014 Press Freedom Index Released: Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have released their annual Press Freedom Index, and the region has been both applauded and condemned. Uruguay is seen to have the freest press in Latin America, ranking 26th out of 180, whilst Mexico and Cuba ranked lowest in the region, coming 152nd and 170th respectively. The report states that regionally: “Many journalists and human rights defenders continue to be exposed to a high level violence that comes from different quarters including organised crime, paramilitary groups, and, sometimes, the state.” Honduras is noted as a country that is particularly dangerous for journalists, which has seen 27 killed since the June 2009 coup which ousted democratically elected president Manual Zelaya. Mexico has also seen more than 100 journalists killed or disappeared since 2000, often with the complicity of local and federal officials. Peru and Colombia are also noted as countries where journalists face reprisals for their coverage of corruption, land and mining conflicts, and drug trafficking. However, both “pioneering” Argentina and Uruguay were lauded for their effective overhauls of broadcasting laws, which democratise the airwaves, reserving a third of broadcast frequencies to non-profit, community organisations. El Salvador: Castaway Arrives Home: José Salvador Alvarenga, the Salvadorian castaway who spent 13 months adrift in the Pacific, has arrived back in El Salvador. The fisherman arrived in Garita Palmera, where he grew up, yesterday to fanfare yesterday, with the entire fishing village turned out to witness the return of their local celebrity. After greeting his family, Alvarenga was admitted to the local hospital, where he is currently recovering from his experience. He has undergone psychological assessments, and is said to be suffering from traumas of having spent so much time alone at sea, and also from witnessing the death of fellow fisherman Ezequiel, who died after refusing to eat after some four months adrift. Alvarenga’s boat washed up on the shores of the Marshall Islands on 30th January, having travelled over 10,000km across open seas from Chiapas, Mexico, where Alvarenga and his companion set out on a fishing expedition on 17th November 2012."

"461964"	"Las Tunas and Nordelta: Two Neighbourhoods, One Reality"	"This article from Revista Mu tells the story of Las Tunas and Nordelta, two neighbourhoods in Tigre divided by much more than a wall."	"***Article originally published in Spanish in Revista Mu *** At 30,000 each, both communities share the same number of residents. Both, also, follow a specific urban model: those on the outside work for those on the inside. A gated wall separates them, with 200 cameras that, in the name of security, protect private neighbourhoods where, just recently, police arrested powerful drug traffickers. Such contrasts reveal in black and white just one of the main problems urban suburbs encounter: how to live so close in such violently different contexts. Barrio Las Tunas and the dividing wall (photo: Gobernación) The word “Vigilantes” is written in graffiti across the grey, barb wired wall. An arrow shoots out from the word and points upward at a watchtower with broken glass. On this side of the wall, a few school children and their mothers wave as they pass by. Horacio, who lives on this side but works on the other side, offers a calculation. “Over there, you’re only greeted by one in every 12 people.” On the other side, in Nordelta, a sticker on the rear window of a car reads: “Don’t envy my life, buy one for yourself.” What does this nearly three-metre-high wall separate? The neighbourhood of Las Tunas is squeezed in between three private ones – La Comarca, Talar del Lago, and Nordelta – and can only be reached by tar roads yet to be paved with concrete. Nordelta’s entrance is reached only after crossing a gate and showing ID, by a smooth asphalt road, between palm trees and lakes that leave one unsure if they were made by God or the neighbourhood’s creator, Eduardo Constantini. Neighbouring Las Tunas does not have drinkable water, nor does it have sewers, natural gas facilities, or 24-hour medical services. Nordelta is the largest private ‘city’ in South America and includes ten private, gated neighbourhoods. It has a modern health centre complete with primary and diagnostic care, a shopping mall with a supermarket and a cinema, more than 70 local businesses, four office buildings, and an Intercontinental hotel, built at a price of $25 million. There are also gated clubs, including a golf club and a marina home to hundreds of boats and yachts. The city refers to itself as Ciudad Pueblo, and its residents have taken the unofficial demonym of nordelteños. Las Tunas calls itself ‘barrio’. It is one of the most densely populated districts in Tigre, and one of the most neglected. Its growth accompanied that of neighbouring Nordelta. “Many people from here work over there as labourers, gardeners, or cleaners,” says Ricardo, a mason who makes swimming pools. Horacio is a gardener who, up until a little while ago, was working at Los Magníficos, a car wash in Nordelta that was revealed at the end of October to have been the property of a drug cartel that operated there – yes, just like in the television series Breaking Bad. Horacio worked 12 hours a day, including weekends, had one day off, and made $3,500 a month. “It is the same as with mining: when they built the country clubs, everyone thought that the neighbourhood was going to improve, but in the end we stayed the same,” says Ricardo. At 30,000, Las Tunas and Nordelta each have the same, symbolic number of residents. Las Tunas stretches over 150 hectares, Nordelta 1,600. The wall between them separates an indivisible reality: for there to be rich people, there must be poor people. Nordelta and surrounding areas from above (photo: Wikipedia) The Necessary Evil Ricardo and Belén’s grandparents used to bathe in the Las Tunas river. Ricardo and Belén would play ball and run about the neighbourhood’s green fields. Today, the couple is going on 30 and has a 18-month-old daughter, Gaia Luna Bahiana, who is growing up next to the same river, one that is now contaminated by the trash from Nordelta’s gated developments, a nearby pulp mill, and two meat packers. The wall, moreover, denies Gaia a view of the horizon. The family of three is part of the social organisation Fogoneros, which has launched two cooperative ventures in Las Tunas: a furniture shop and a bakery. Fogoneros also has a high school diploma programme for adults, a gender workshop, and a soup kitchen that seats 40 people. The carpenters are about to deliver a piece of furniture that they had ordered. The bakery is selling hot pastries. The adult education course has finished for today, but you can see the projects from today’s sexual education class. A man’s silhouette displays the following words: dysfunctional, violent, miserable, liars, companion, good father, a necessary evil. Definitions on the female figure read: breasts, cachula, sexy, trash, work, rebel, procreators. The Eyes of Tigre Belén attends the adult education course while her daughter goes to the cooperative’s day-care. Her husband, Ricardo, is involved as much as he can, when he isn’t building private pools in Nordelta. “What a contradiction, right?” he says. “To be in a cooperative and then go and work for the rich.” He laughs and pulls out the Fogoneros‘ newspaper, the Eyes of Tigre. The title on the cover reads “Lights, camera… security? For whom are the security controls meant?” The paper goes on to discuss a recent police raid that dismantled a drug cartel that had been operating for years in Nordelta. In Ciudad Pueblo‘s gated communities, Los Castores, Marina del Golf, and Santa Catalina, Jesús Antonio Yepez Gaviria, a 47-year-old from Colombia, had been operating alongside his wife and other members of the cartel. His arrest followed that of his trafficking partner John Eduard Martínez Grajales, aka ‘El Doctor’. Also in the cartel were two Peruvians and two Argentines whose names remain unknown. During the raid, at least 114 kg of cocaine were seized, in addition to seven high-end cars. It was ‘El Doctor’ who was running the car wash Los Magníficos. El Doctor, however, was not the only distinguished business owner from Ciudad Pueblo to be detained. Henry de Jesús López Londoño, a Colombian who goes by ‘Mi Sangre’, was one of the most wanted drug traffickers in the world at the time of his arrest at the end of 2012. He is awaiting extradition to the US. Again, no Argentines near Mi Sangre. Operation “Los Magníficos” included 12 arrests and the capture of over 100kg of cocaine, implicating a car wash of the same name in Nordelta. (photo: Ministry of Security, via flickr) After a series of burglaries close to its security gates, it was revealed that Ciudad Pueblo had invested US$1.2m in safety, including more than 200 cameras and a 24-hour operations centre. However, the neighbourhood that the media has stigmatised is the one on the other side of the wall, Las Tunas, though the residents are raising their own issues. “Our cooperative was once broken into, and we were robbed of everything,” Belén says. “There’s supposed to be a security camera here in the corner, but it was not working that day. When it’s for their own good, it’s always there, but for the people it isn’t.” “It is true that there is a problem of violence and insecurity, but it is also true that the media exacerbates the picture,” argues a piece in ‘Eyes of Tigre’. Ricardo remembers that the last time the media actually came to Las Tunas was after a kidnapping took place in 2008. “They only come to Las Tunas for that kind of thing, not because those who live here have a problem or because we are denouncing the flooding and contamination we deal with. In those situations the media is not allowed to come.” “Who won’t allow them?” Ricardo and Belén respond in unison: “Massa”. A War of Two Worlds The last time [former Tigre mayor] Sergio Massa visited Las Tunas was in 2005, accompanied by then-president Néstor Kirchner. Massa was head of ANSES, the National Administration of Social Security, and was also a candidate for congress. “They were campaigning,” recounts Ricardo. “They arrived in a helicopter and then proceeded to walk around the neighbourhood on foot. The craziest thing is that the streets they were walking on had been paved just three hours earlier.” Belen adds, “It was almost like they were paving as they walked.” What, then, is the insecurity? “We don’t have drinking water or a sewer system. Only 40 homes have gas, and that is only because they lie in the path of Nordelta’s gas line,” Ricardo says. Las Tunas’ health centre closes at 6pm, says Belén, so access to emergency health services is only possible by taking a bus to nearby Pacheco. Furthermore, Las Tunas floods whenever it rains heavily. “We are stuck in a kind of pit. They raised the private neighbourhoods and left us below.” Nordelta accelerates the tsunami. “They close the floodgates of the Las Tunas river, so all the water comes down here.” The last time this happened was during April and May. The floods carried away beds, clothes, children’s toys, among other things. When the arsenic-polluted waters rose to knee level, a combination of desperation and logic compelled Las Tunas residents to break a hole in a section of the wall separating their community from the Nordelta golf course. It was 3:30am and Nordelta’s private security – for whom the drug-traffickers and money launderers do not exist – fought them off with rubber bullets. Residents of Las Tunas protest after recent flooding (photo: Télam) Landscaping Who said the following? “The main problems residents face are those associated with unemployment, malnutrition, high numbers of young people dropping out of school to look for a job, high rates of teenage pregnancy, and a low possibility of acceptance into formal education, to name just a few.” The answer: The Nordelta Foundation. The organisation runs a series of social programmes in Las Tunas, funded by donations. Ricardo calls it “pure bullshit”. The group’s new year’s dinner was attended by then-mayor Sergio Massa and his wife. Massa spoke about the local problems of that venture, to which the name Constantini is also attached. Nordelta is also the name of Ciudad Pueblo’s own magazine. Directed by Juana Constantini, the publication covers topics such as decor, latest trends, tourism, art, fashion, food, education, golf, and landscaping. Walsh and Urondo in Nordelta In its special tenth anniversary edition, Nordelta magazine included a feature covering ArteBA, which began with the following sentences: “It’s still not for everyone, but it is becoming more and more frequent that common people are inspired to walk through its halls.” Elsewhere in the publication one reads that the University of San Andrés has begun to offer courses in Nordelta, from philosophy (on “the complex relationship that exists between political power and property”), literature (noblesse oblige: “Works covered include those of the Lamborghini brothers, Manuel Puig, Paco Urondo, Rodolfo Walsh), and art history (“Contents: the fall of Peronism in 1955, in many ways, paved the way for a refreshing outlook in the world of art”). Also included in this edition is an interview with Ciudad Pueblo resident, football player Matías Almeyda, who confesses: “When I came back from Italy in 2005, I realised this is as close as it gets to a different world.” Another article describes the trend for women to have personal shoppers. An article entitled “With the stick between your feet” features advice from Robert Mojarra Pereyra on how to improve your golf swing. Healthy People, ‘N’ Number Plates An editorial in Nordelta magazine describes the typical nordelteño. “He or she is an essentially healthy, sociable, cheerful, and hopeful person. It is one who believes in a project, who delights in the music of birds, the purity of Nordelta’s lakes, the adventure of sailing. The nordelteño is one who chooses to live in an environment that values greenery, wellbeing, and sport, for a life full of nature where one can build their home.” Horacio, the gardener without the choice to live in such an environment, has written his own take on the editorial: * “Only one out of 12 people says hello.” * “They don’t carry bags when they walk their dogs, leaving its droppings right there,” he says, pointing at his workplace. * “Most of them have a car with a number plate beginning in ‘N’ [from 2013]” * “The kids are daring. They break things and then tell private security officers: ‘My dad is so-and-so, I’ll have you fired’.” The best sold newspaper is, by far, [conservative broadsheet] La Nación. Another Heritage The gated neighbourhoods of Buenos Aires province have their beginnings in the urban planning projects drawn up during the last dictatorship. They flourished thanks to the Urban Highway Plan, which connected peripheral towns with the capital. A second trigger was decree 8912/77 for Zoning and Land Use, which prohibited urbanisation in flood zones but also set aside land for investment for the construction of country club communities. Real estate spectators jumped on these large, available spaces and began transforming them into tempting developments marketed toward the middle class. Around this time, two local infrastructure and construction companies, DyOPSA and Supercemento, bought 1,600 hectares in Tigre at a cost of US$1 to US$3 per square metre, because they were considered floodplains. Now, each hectare costs between US$800 and US$1,500 [per square metre]. The approval of Nordelta’s development materialised in 1992 with provincial decree 1736/92, under the argument of taking advantage of “lands in deserted areas”. The first walls began to be constructed in 1998 after the incorporation of Consultatio Inversora, a branch of Colsultatio S.A., owned by entrepreneur Eduardo Constantini, who joined the board of directors of Nordelta S.A. and attracted Swiss capital that helped move along the urbanisation. The first family moved into Nordelta in 2000. Its shopping centre opened in 2005, along with a health centre and its first schools, paving the way for the possibility of a Buenos Aires version of the Truman Show. Its schools include Cardenal Pironio-Marin, Northlands, Michael Ham, Saint Luke’s, and Northfields, with average monthly fees ranging from $3,500 to $6,000. Today, Nordelta has around 30,000 residents with plans to build enough homes to double that number. However, the sales manager for the community, Fernando Pacotto, says that Nordelta “still does not have the population density necessary” to expand the commercial offer “because everything has to be successful”. For example, the Nordelta location of the Disco chain of supermarkets is currently one of the most profitable in the country. Recently, the Belgian bakery chain Le Pain Quotidien announced it would be opening one of its first locations in Argentina in Nordelta, with large English-language signs. A wall outside a supermarket in Nordelta (photo: Martin Auad) There is a lot of construction going on. Prices: * A 38 square-metre apartment facing the river: US$100,000. * A four-bedroom house on the golf course: US$1.5m. * Another, in the neighbourhood of La Isla: US$3.4m. In Las Tunas, the landscape is quite different. The water, accessible only through community faucets, is contaminated with high levels of arsenic, which causes skin and respiratory diseases in the majority of children. Paediatricians warn families not to bathe children younger than five in the water. Though some construction has begun to facilitate easier access to water – with two projects funded by the Nordelta foundation – the water continues to be contaminated. The Model As mayor of Tigre, Sergio Massa consolidated a management model that sees in the gated community the possibility of [the state] increasing tax revenue (taxes there are much higher) while excusing itself from the responsibility of providing investment, state support, and infrastructure for its citizens. With private investment, Tigre found a solution to the issues of transport, sanitation, public health, and education, meanwhile orienting its expenses toward security (understood as police and surveillance cameras) in its effort to contain and hide behind a wall the other side of the coin: the neighbourhood of Las Tunas. “People see that Massa has done well for Tigre, planting palm trees and encouraging tourism, and the people vote for all this. People have little awareness; for many years they did not participate in Argentine politics, so they vote for whoever seems most charismatic,” Ricardo says. On Tigre’s not-so-charismatic Kirchnerist city councillors, Ricardo says: “They were with Massa four years ago and they are just now saying the country clubs are bad. A few days ago they came here and were showing the neighbourhood’s problems, the flooding and all that, but it was part of a campaign against Massa. They never had spoken about these problems when they were with him.” Perhaps with similar electoral intentions, the province’s Ministry of Social Development released the following data illustrating the municipality of Tigre’s priorities, and showing that Las Tunas is not an exception to the rule. * Health, community outreach, and human development in Massa’s Tigre made up 29% of the budget, while the provincial average surpasses 58%. * Additionally, 49,000 homes remain disconnected from the natural gas network. * A total of 90,000 homes lack sewages. * Tigre’s infant mortality rate is at 12.9 per thousand, the highest in the north and above the provincial average of 11.5 per thousand. According to the Delta Assembly and the residents of Villa La Ñata, Tigre’s land concentration can be defined as follows: barely 10% of the population occupies 60% of Tigre’s territory – 148 square km – with 90% occupying the remaining 40% of land. It is also estimated that of Tigre’s 20 km of green shores on the Luján river, there are only nine blocks with public access to the water. Italian sociologist Ota de Leonardis claims that these kinds of places involve the “territorialisation of inequality”. English rocker Roger Waters, of Pink Floyd, made The Wall to express the mental wall that people build to shut themselves from the world. Philosopher Zygmunt Bauman states: “To fence in oneself in a gated community inevitably translates to excluding everyone else from the worthy, pleasant, and safe places and effectively closing them off in their poor neighbourhoods. In big cities, space is divided into gated communities (voluntary ghettos) and slums (involuntary ghettos).” As we leave Nordelta, we are once again asked to show our ID. Two owls rest under the shade of a tree, attentively looking at the visitors in the same way as the two guards next to the wall stare us down. Beyond the Northlands school, behind a wall of two metres and to the left, is the road that leads to the Pan-American Highway. A wall also separates the route from the green of the country clubs. Along the wall, an electric fence. And to the right, a tall, hard reed bed, which hides Las Tunas. Translated by Brendan O’Boyle."

"532504"	"Vendimia Gains Momentum in Mendoza"	"Mendoza's national grape harvest festival of Vendimia is growing in fervour as it pushes ever closer to this coming weekend's climax. Madeline Blasberg reports."	"As wineries fill their tanks to the limit with this year’s harvest, the national Vendimia festival gathers momentum across Mendoza Province, growing in fervour as it pushes ever closer to this weekend’s main event. The final wave of Grape Harvest festivities began last week with Vendimia Federal, a seven-day celebration that attracted more than 50,000 participants from throughout Mendoza Province and beyond. Hosted by the Mendoza Ministry of Culture in the city’s San Martín Park, Vendimia Federal shined the spotlight on the 18 Mendoza districts. Each district decorated and staffed a stand, featuring regional products, flavours, landscapes. Vendimina Queen candidates. Each of Mendoza province’s 18 districts are represented. (photo: Fiesta Nacional de la Vendimia facebook) Though the Vendimia Queen candidates were present at each stand to smile and hand out pamphlets to the stream of passersby, the true royalty of the event consisted of a shabby but passionate group of chefs, dancers, musicians, and artisans. It was this creative group that shouldered the important task of representing the best (and tastiest) bits of culture from each of their respective home districts. Mendozans of all varieties set up shop selling handmade jewellery, carvings, leatherwork, and gaucho gear. Or stood behind blazing fires as the gentle grey cloud of asado smoke wafted through the open air, an irresistible siren song to Argentine appetites. In the art, the music, the food and the dancing, Vendimia Federal accomplished its goal: to highlight the diverse – and yet unified – cultural identity of the province. Bendicion de los Frutos event in Vendimia, Mendoza (photo: Fiesta Nacional de la Vendimia facebook) Then came the Bendición de los Frutos (Blessing of the Fruit) on 2nd March, a live music concert with a Catholic flourish. More than 10,000 spectators hunkered down with their lawn chairs and blankets to enjoy the show, featuring 500 voices from the city’s finest choirs. The ceremony and celebration is an annual blessing of all the fruits that come forth from Mendoza’s desert soils and an offering of thanks to the Virgin de la Carrodilla for protecting vineyards in the many days that lead up to the grape harvest. The night included the reading of a letter from Pope Francis, a sermon from Mendoza’s Archbishop Carlos María Franzini, and closed with hundreds of voices shouting in unison: ¡Salud! Next up on the roster, was the 6th annual Megadegustación, a unique event best described as a block party wine tasting. Guests enjoyed more than 250 wines from some of the province’s most important names in winemaking. Access to the block party, as always, was free to the public, but access to the wine tasting was reserved for those who paid a small admission fee for a wine glass and a set number of sips. Stands stretched down two city blocks in the heart of Mendoza downtown, with a small outdoor stage at the epicentre, filling the streets with live music. Though both Vendimia Federal and the Megadegustación have run their course, this is only just the beginning.  Having successfully warmed up the tens of thousands of locals and tourists that have descended on Mendoza city, the main event is just around the corner. Up next are the following activities: 7th March, 9pm: Via Blanca Queen’s Parade, winding through the downtown area of Mendoza City 8th March, 10pm: El Carrusel de las Reinas Parade and the final Vendimia Show, Acto Central 9th-11th March, 9pm: Repetitions of the Acto Central"	"TOP STORY; Travel; Travel Feature; Travel Review; festival; harvest; mendoza; vendimia; wine"	"http://www.argentinaindependent.com/travel/vendimia-gains-momentum-in-mendoza/"	"2014-03-06 18:20:51"	"2014-03-06 18:00:33"	"85"	"General"	"argentina independent"
"432875"	"Argentina News Roundup: 20th February 2014"	"Today's news from around Argentina: 'Masacre de La Carcova' trial begins; Western Union announces changes to ease money sending; Man forced to pay damages for leaving pregnant ex"	"Human rights organisations joined civil society outside the Masacre de la Carcova trial in San Martín. (Photo: Gustavo Amarelle/Télam/lz) ‘Masacre de La Carcova’ Trial Begins: The trial against Buenos Aires Province policemen Gustavo Rey and Gustavo Vega opened today in San Martín, Greater Buenos Aires. The pair are accused of having killed two teenagers who they believed were involved in the looting of a train than had derailed in La Carcova, José León Suárez in 2011. Franco Almirón and Mauricio Ramos, aged 16 and 17, were both killed in the incident on 3rd February 2011, and their friend Joaquín Romero, 19, was seriously injured. The police are also accused of covering up the killings. Investigations by the Centre for Legal and Social Studies (CELS) human rights organisation unveiled that on the day of the incident, the three friends were riding their bikes to look for cardboard in the nearby CEAMSE rubbish dump and had stopped to see what had happened as the train had derailed. When they tried to get close to the train, officers responded disproportionately by shooting at them. Romero was injured, and Almirón and Ramos took cover behind a pile of junk. But after a tear gas cannon was fired they were forced out of their cover, and were both shot fatally whilst attempting to flee the scene. CELS, whose investigation revealed the police cover-up, has called for a case to be opened into the officers’ disproportionate response to the lootings and also that more senior officials, likely to have given the orders to the policemen to use deadly force, also be charged. The trial is expected to last until 11th March. Western Union Announces Changes to Ease Money Sending: The local subsidiary of Western Union has increased the amount of money it is possible to send to some countries from $1,150 per month to $4000 – or US$500 – per day. The countries included are the United States, Canada and the rest of Latin America. However, tighter restrictions remain for those wanting to send money to other continents, who are limited to $1,800 per day. Tourists and foreigners living temporarily in Argentina will not be able to use the new system, and are advised to go to the tax office AFIP to send or receive money. Argentines and permanent residents must take a photocopy of their CUIT or CUIL and a copy of their DNI. Those wishing to send money will have to pay 35% commission on the value of the money being sent, which would mean a cost of $10.90 per dollar, higher than the official exchange rate, which is hovering around $8, but lower than the ‘blue’, which is nearer $12. Man Forced to Pay Damages for Leaving Pregnant Ex: The Supreme Court of Corrientes province has ruled that a man must pay damages to his former partner for the “moral damage” he inflicted after suddenly leaving her while she was pregnant. The ruling sets a new precedent in the province, although judges Guillermo Horacio Semhan, Fernando Augusto Niz and Juan Carlos Codello have yet to calculate the level of damages that will be awarded. In their decision, they highlighted that the woman “spent the entire pregnancy without the company or spiritual support of the progenitor”, and that the man had demonstrated “abandonment, denial of paternity, irresponsibility, and bad faith”. They highlighted that these were things suffered by the mother, and that their daughter was not the victim in this case."

"395080"	"Latin America News Roundup: 14th February 2014"	"Today's news from around the region: Venezuela's Maduro condemns violence, calls for peace; Bolivia: abortion to be more accessible; Brazil's MST ends national congress"	"President Nicolás Maduro (photo courtesy of Venezuelan government) Venezuela: Maduro Condemns Violence, Calls for Peace: Last night, President Nicolás Maduro addressed Venezuela in a live televised speech, calling for calm after the previous day’s turmoil. He announced a mass rally for peace on Saturday, and called on demonstrators to avoid violence, saying: ”This Saturday, all of Caracas will mobilise against fascism, violence, and coup attempts to demonstrate that on the streets what we want is peace, coexistence, democracy, and socialism.” In further developments, it was revealed that two of Wednesday’s victims were killed with same gun. Maduro added that state intelligence services had caught members of the opposition saying there would be deaths during Wednesday’s march, adding to speculation that the violence was planned in a way to blame the government. The governor of Táchira state in west Venezuela, José Gregorio Vielma Mora, has reported that Colombian paramilitaries and terrorists had joined the student protests in the region, and that these infiltrators had tried to damage an electricity station which provided power to 63,000 people. Several Latin American leaders have condemned Wednesday’s violence, and spoke of their support for Maduro’s government. Maduro is also set to launch today a ‘National Pacification Plan’ as part of efforts to tackle crime and security in Venezuela. The plan was announced in January soon after the murder of former beauty queen Mónica Spear, and was developed after collecting ideas and suggestions from around the country. One of the main objectives of the new programme is to reduce the use of guns. “Here no-one can carry pistols or rifles,” declared Maduro after Wednesday’s violence. “After 14th February, there will be suitable mechanisms so that anyone who hands in their gun will have ways to normalise their situation.” The plan is due to be launched in front of governors, ministers, and mayors from all over the country. Bolivia: Abortion to be more Accessible: In a decision published today, Bolivia’s Constitutional Court has decided abortions can go ahead without a judicial order. However, the Court went on to clarify that this did not mean abortion was being decriminalised in the Andean nation. Abortion is illegal in Bolivia except in cases of rape, incest, kidnap not followed by marriage, and when the life of the mother is in danger, but until now, women needed a court order for the abortion to go ahead. Speaking at a press conference in Sucre, president of the Court, Ruddy Flores, said: “The only requirement for an abortion to go ahead is that a complaint has been made to the relevant, competent authorities.” The Constitutional Court has also ordered the Legislative Assembly to develop a new law to establish and regulate women’s sexual and reproductive rights. Brazil: Landless Workers’ Movement Ends 6th National Congress: The Landless Workers’ Movement (MST) closed its 6th National Congress today in Brasilia, in the presence of 15,000 campesinos and 250 international guests. Yesterday, President Dilma Rousseff received a group of representatives of the organisation at the Presidential Palace, the first time the MST have been able to directly speak to the leader. At the end of the meeting, Rousseff promised to create an inter-ministerial group to examine actions related to land reform and announced plans to accelerate the pace of rural settlements. The meeting marked an initial success for the MST, whose conference had the theme of ‘Fight, Construct Agrarian Reform’ for the its 1.5m members."

"408746"	"The Fake Borges"	"Graciela Mochkofsky delves into the world of antique books and illegal art trafficking as she follows the mysterious case of a valuable Borges' first edition stolen from the National Library."	"***Article originally published in Spanish in El Puercoespín *** The world of books and manuscripts is a small one, full of intrigues, prone to betrayals and frauds. Alberto Casares has lived in this world for decades. President of the antique booksellers of Buenos Aires, he is one of Argentina’s biggest experts on the subject. He’s got the perfect physique–du-rôl: grey, messy beard; soft body; intense and wary look. Mistrust is a requisite of his job. A few months ago, he was offered a 17th-century original edition of ‘Don Quixote of La Mancha’ for €1m. He studied it carefully, cautious but unable to repress an emotion akin to that of a pilgrim before the Holy Sepulchre. It was a well-known forgery from the 19th century, he found; even though it had a value of its own, it was worth no more than €200,000. The seller took it away, determined to find a more unsuspecting client, and Casares was left alone with the melancholy of having lost that object that was never his. What would some people give to own it? Talking about a former client, he once told me: “Suddenly, ambition drove him to do illegal things. But that’s happened many times. Bibliographers commit crimes due to the mad desire to own certain things.” That former client was Daniel Pastore, collector of antique books and first editions, heir to a pharmaceutical fortune and owner of Imago Mundi, Buenos Aires’ most elegant antique books and prints shop, which closed down a few years ago due to a succession of international scandals involving him. He was annoyed and fascinated by Pastore. He was 18 the first time he walked into his book shop: he returned regularly ever since. He was handsome, rich, likeable, and an erudite, which made him a good client, but he was also pedantic and liked to make Casares feel he knew more than him. Sometimes he did know more. But not about Jorge Luis Borges. One morning in late 1999, Pastore brought a copy of the first edition of ‘Fervor de Buenos Aires’. It is Borges’ first published book (he had written two more before, which remained unpublished), but, for men like Pastore and Casares, it was something else: the most valuable first edition of Argentina’s greatest 20th century literary glory (and one of the greatest in the world). On the outside, a copy of the first edition of ‘Fervor de Buenos Aires’ is a thin book, without prologue or imprint. The edition was paid for by the writer’s father when he was 23. “I wrote these poems between 1921 and 1923, and the volume came out early in 1923,” says Borges in his English-language essay ‘Autobiographical Notes‘, published by The New Yorker in September 1970. “The book was actually printed in five days; the printing had to be rushed, because it was necessary for us to return to Europe. (My father wanted to consult his Genevan doctor about his sight). I had bargained for 64 pages, but the manuscript ran too long and at the last minute five poems had to be left out – mercifully. I can’t remember a single thing about them. The book was produced in a somewhat boyish spirit. No proof-reading was done, no table of contents was provided, and the pages were unnumbered. My sister [Norah] made a woodcut for the cover, and three hundred copies were printed (…) I never thought of sending copies to the booksellers or out for review. Most of them I just gave away.” On the inside, the unique depiction of an experience. Borges had lived in Europe between 1914 and 1921, and the 46 poems he gathered in ‘Fervor de Buenos Aires’ reflect what he found upon returning to Argentina. “The city of his childhood had changed, not just because the years had passed but because those years were decisive for Argentina,” explains Beatriz Sarlo, one of the great experts on his works. “During the second decade of the 20th century, that which was bubbling under the surface when the Borges family left for Europe in 1914, was consolidated. At the time, Buenos Aires was being built as a modern city; when Borges returned, though it was still transforming, it had almost lost the most colourful marks of its criollo village past. (…) Borges returned, then, to a place he did not know. The shock, which Simmel has described as the intense and surprising relationship that is established with the modern city, is magnified in the situation of someone arriving from Europe where he has also experienced the shock of the avant-garde. That combination (the avant-garde rhetoric and the surprise over finding an urban space so different to what he remembered from his childhood) produces an alchemy which Borges turns into his first literary invention.” Borges stated that: “‘Fervor de Buenos Aires’ foreshadows everything I would do afterwards.” Any self-respecting collector of his works owns a copy from that first edition. As there are not many left -according to Casares, around 150; according to Alejandro Vaccaro, Borges collector and biographer, no more than 15 in circulation- they are not easy to get. But Pastore had that copy in his hands. Could Casares confirm that it was a legitimate first edition? “I was offered it at a very tempting price,” he revealed, without saying how much. Casares knew it was worth between US$30,000 and 40,000. He examined the book and identified it immediately. It was ‘Fervor de Buenos Aires’ from the ‘Peña Collection’, sold to the National Library a couple of months earlier by Juan Manuel Peña, its owner. He knew this copy very well because six years earlier Peña had lent it to him to make a facsimile edition (300 copies): it had no cover, it showed a hand-written dedication by the author to poet Nydia Lamarque, and in the fifth line of the poem ‘Villa Urquiza’ there was a correction, also hand-written: Atendido de amor y rica esperanza, ¡cuántas veces he visto morir sus calles agrestes en el Juicio Final de cada tarde! La frecuente asistencia de un encanto acuña en mi recuerdo una predilecta eficacia ese arrabal cansado, y es habitual evocación de mis horas la vista de sus calles;  (…) The article ‘una‘ was crossed out, and on the right margin Borges had changed it for the preposition ‘con‘. So, “acuña en mi recuerdo una predilecta eficacia” became “acuña en mi recuerdo con predilecta eficacia.” Borges used to do this: he would correct his verses as he gave them away, especially in this edition, which had been published with mistakes due to the rush. (Many copies of the first edition show the same hand-written correction.) “The edition is good,” said Casares. “It was stolen from the National Library. Who gave it to you?” Pastore mentioned Guillermo Billinghurst, a “mediocre bookbinder,” according to Casares, who used to bring him Borges’ first editions of dubious origins: a client had left it with him for binding, he would say every time, and sometimes they did not return to pick it up. “I am going to report this robbery to the National Library,” Casares warned Pastore. “You do whatever you want.” He saw him leave with the stolen book. But he remained “deeply convinced that he was not going to buy it.” Fourteen years later, Casares bitterly regrets that outburst of civic responsibility. What happened afterwards, he told me, taught him that in Argentina it is better to keep your mouth shut. *** Before filing the report, Casares called Juan Manuel Peña to warn him that the book from his collection had been stolen from the library. Instead of thanking him, Peña begged him to hide it: the Library still had not paid him for the books, which he had already delivered, and a scandal could ruin his chances of getting the money. Casares, determined to do the right thing, talked to Alejandro Vaccaro, the Borges specialist, who understood the seriousness of the matter and offered to go with him to explain it to the director of the National Library, Francisco Delich. They got an audience, but, just like Peña, the director seemed to not take the news very well. Firstly, as both Casares and Vaccaro told me, Delich and a couple of employees who participated in the meeting denied that the copy had been stolen – it was, they said, in an itinerant exhibition about Borges stuck in Portugal and with “problems” returning to the country (a Library employee confirmed much later that the Argentine government took three years to repatriate that exhibition). Also, the Library did not have a full description of this copy, which it had bought just before sending it out to the exhibition, which made it hard to confirm it was the same copy. Exasperated, Casares demanded the police be told and that they raid Billinghurst’s apartment immediately and recover the book. Far from it, the employees only went as far as initiating an internal inquiry. *** The years went by. Billinghurst, the alleged possessor of the stolen book, had already died of liver disease by the time the internal inquiry finally confirmed that the copy of ‘Fervor de Buenos Aires’ had, in effect, disappeared. Casares was summoned to the Ministry of Education to ratify his theft report. The new bureaucrat that took his statement warned him: “Be aware that, if you ratify this, it will get to the federal justice.” And so it did. The officers at the federal court of judge Jorge Ballestero, used to dealing with cases of illegal drugs or government corruption, did not quite understand the gravity of the matter: it was not a manuscript by Borges or a unique copy -it was a printed book, one of many that were in circulation. And even if it had Borges’ handwriting on its first page and in a poem in the middle, what was, really, its importance? The Library itself had another copy of the same book, and the same edition. (Fourteen years later, when I called the judge, now promoted to the Court of Appeals, to ask about that file and find out how the case had ended, he said he could not remember.) Jorge Luis Borges, photographed by Grete Stern in 1951 (source: Wikipedia) Illegal trafficking in cultural property, which includes books and antique manuscripts, is considered to be the third in the world in terms of volume, behind arms and drugs. According to some estimates repeated in international conferences on the subject, it is worth something like US$6bn per year. Interpol, which had to create a specific office to deal with this crime two decades ago, says that it is impossible to confirm this estimate. It is known that London is the main centre of illegal trafficking of rare books and manuscripts, and that the United States is its main destination, where there seems to be enough people willing to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars, even millions, for a rare book that no one else has and only they can enjoy. It is also known that these people rarely commit the crime in person: normally, they buy from the thief. According to professor Travis McDade, an expert at the University of Illinois Law School, many do it because owning a unique symbol of universal culture makes some people feel special, just as unique: “Never underestimate people’s necessity to be considered intelligent.” Nobody knows how many valuable books have been stolen and bought in the black market, and every now and then a scandal breaks which proves it. In 2003, for example, it was found that an employee at the Royal Library in Denmark had stolen, in the previous 30 years, over 3,000 unique books, amongst them manuscripts by Immanuel Kant, 15th century atlases, and first editions of Martin Luther. The case only became public because, after the employee died, his widow tried to sell the collection to auction house Christie’s. The value of these books and manuscripts does not only lie on the fact that a millionaire might be willing to pay for them, but, as both buyers and traffickers understand, on its value for universal culture. When he was called to give a statement about his report, four years after filing it, Casares was unable to make the employees at the Argentine court understand this. *** No one seemed to care, apparently, about the civic aspect of the matter either. The National Library is as old as Argentina: it was created in 1810, together with the first national government, and its first director was Mariano Moreno, one of the greatest national heroes and founder of the country’s first newspaper. It was, at some point, something to be proud of. But towards 1960 it became clear that the building that housed it no longer had the room or the conditions to accommodate the collections. Books would get lost or ruined. The issue became a matter of public debate and, in order to address it, president Arturo Frondizi issued a decree purchasing three hectares in the neighbourhood of Palermo and put out a tender to construct a new building. The winner was architect Clorindo Testa, with an ambitious brutalist project of reinforced concrete structures, at style that flourished in the ’50s. Construction, however, began 11 years later. Then it stopped. Then it started again. Then it stopped again. Million-peso budgets were successively assigned to it, but were never spent. It ended up becoming a symbol of the corruption and lack of interest in culture of the successive military dictatorships that ruled the country. Only at the beginning of the ’90s, and thanks to a massive loan by the Spanish government that helped to finalise a work planned 30 years earlier, president Carlos Menem ordered that books and collections be moved and inaugurated the building. Argentina’s National Library (photo: Wikipedia) Borges’ name is inextricably linked to the history of the Library. He was its director for 18 years, between 1955 and 1973. Books were already disappearing then. When asked whether this was true, in typical fashion he replied: “I can’t tell whether books are being stolen because I’m blind.” It was under his mandate that the move was decided. Deborah Yanover, owner of Librería Norte in Buenos Aires, told me that his father, the late Héctor Yanover, founder of the bookshop and director of the Library between 1994 and 1996, used to frequently receive different characters in his shop which offered him first editions and manuscripts… stolen from the Library of which he was a director. According to Horacio Salas, another former director, the library lost some 200,000 books in the last few decades. Out of how many? No one knows. That is right: no one knows how many books there are, or should be, in Argentina’s National Library. Horacio González, its current director, confessed that the Library “has approximately a million books and some four million other pieces (newspapers, music sheets, records, photographs, etc.). I don’t have exact numbers and at this point it is very difficult to have them.” A recent journalistic report noted that, “after the user returns the book, it goes down the lift and it is put back where it belongs. However, if for some reason it is placed in the wrong spot, there is the risk the book could get lost for years, decades, or even forever.” This problem is not exclusive to the Library. State archives are woefully neglected: a naval officer opened the door of a basement in the Navy building for me a few years ago, where they stored official documents from the first half of the 20th century; he found it had turned into a lake of wastewater in which boxes, papers, and rats floated. In 2001, an undersecretary at the Interior Ministry found by chance, whilst he was moving offices, a very valuable file with classified documents from the last dictatorship (1976-1983). The first thing he did with it was… to call me: maybe some of it would be useful for a book I was writing? I could take whatever I wanted. Only after I wrote about it on the newspaper I was working for was he forced to hand in the file to the office in charge of processing it. Recently, in November 2013, another massive file with 1,500 secret records from the last dictatorship appeared at the Defence Ministry when a janitor decided to… clean. At the newspaper section of the Congress Library, it is common to find that pages have been ripped off and articles and photographs cut out from the newspaper and magazine collections. Or to ask for a book that one looked up in the past and be told that the book has never been in the Library. That is, that it is no longer there. *** In mid-2003, whilst the investigation languished in court, Pastore called Casares again, this time not to show him but to ask him for a copy of the first edition of ‘Fervor de Buenos Aires’. He was preparing a collection of Borges’ first editions and other treasures, for which he expected to get a record price: US$4m. It would be auctioned at Bloomsbury Book Auctions, in London. Casares did not have one and he could not get one from the collectors he called: those who had it, did not want to sell. Instead, he sold Pastore one of the facsimiles he had made ten years earlier from the stolen Peña collection book for little money and, for US$10,000, a copy of a first edition of another Borges book, ‘Luna de enfrente’ (poems, 1925). Pastore also asked him to write the prologue for the auction catalogue. On 28th October 2003, almost a month before the date scheduled for the auction, the catalogue made it into Alejandro Vaccaro’s hands, the collector that had accompanied Casares to file the report on the theft of the book at the National Library. Going through the pages in search of something to buy, Vaccaro found the description of the copy of ‘Fervor de Buenos Aires’ included in the offer: it was an exact match of the copy stolen from the Library. There was the dedication to Nydia Lamarque (her name had been erased, but the closing was still there: “Sincerely, Jorge Luis Borges”) and the correction on ‘Villa Urquiza’. Also, the summary mentioned that the copy had belonged to the Peña collection. There were no doubts: it was the stolen copy! What Vaccaro did not understand was why Casares, who had reported the crime as soon as it had happened, had now turned into an accomplice. He called a journalist from La Nación and the following day everyone knew that a valuable book stolen from the National Library would be auctioned off in London for £22,000. It was an international scandal and an embarrassment for the country. Pastore and the organiser of the auction, an Italian man called Massimo De Caro, claimed there was an error in the catalogue. Casares explained that the catalogue writer, a Bolivian named Molina, had the facsimile before him as he wrote it. Hence the mistake. But the book offered in the auction was not the one from the Peña collection. But no one believed them. They had to remove the book from the auction, which turned out to be a failure. Pastore and De Caro offered to take the book to the Library so that its new director, Horacio Salas, could confirm it was not the stolen copy. Salas accepted, but before receiving them he called judge Ballestero, who was in charge of the by then dormant case, and he in turn alerted Interpol. When Pastore and De Caro walked into the director’s office, they found the police officers, who took the book and put it under custody of the court. *** Borges with President Arturo Frondizi in 1958, when he was director of the National Library (photo: Wikipedia) Casares, now suspected of having taken part in the crime whose investigation he himself had initiated, testified before the judge that the book was not the same one that had been stolen from the Library or the facsimile he had sold to Pastore. It was, he explained, a third book, similar to the other two: it had the correction on the fifth line of the poem ‘Villa Urquiza’, the dedication with the erased name, and the closing: “Sincerely, Jorge Luis Borges.” But Casares pointed out that the stroke on the correction line in the poem was different, and that, unlike the stolen copy, this one was bound and had the original cover. Laura Rosato, in charge of the Borges collection at the National Library, testified in court that she could not tell whether it was the stolen copy or not, because she had barely seen it for a few minutes when she opened the boxes of the Peña collection. The book had not even been stamped and properly registered as belonging to the Library. Vaccaro denounced Casares as a liar and even showed up at the entrance of the yearly antique book fair to hand out flyers against “book thieves.” The issue was settled when Juan Manuel Peña assured that, indeed, that was the book that had belonged to his collection and that he had sold to the Library. In mid-September 2007, eight years after its disappearance, the judge ruled that the book was indeed the stolen copy and, without pointing blame or imposing punishments, ordered that it be returned to the Library. And with that, the investigation was closed. “Borges returns to the National Library,” celebrated La Nación. “It was proven that the book belonged to the National Library,” announced Horacio González, the Library’s new director (the fifth since the theft). “Judge Ballestero acted with precision and fervour, to make a play on words with the title of Borges’ work, and it will be made available to the public shortly.” *** Three weeks before the ruling, a Uruguayan man named César Gómez Rivero, a Buenos Aires-based collector of antique books and maps, was looking up some books from the 15th century at Spain’s National Library, in Madrid. Without anyone noticing, he used a razor blade to cut out 19 unique prints, including two world maps from Claudius Ptolemy’s ‘Cosmographia’ printed in 1482 and considered some of the most beautiful woodcuts of early world maps; the Magellan Strait Reconnaissance, a map drawn by two Spanish sailors, the García Nodal brothers, after a 1618 expedition, printed in 1621; the Teperata Antipodum Nobis Incognita sketch map, by medieval geographer Macrobius, printed in 1485; the Media Nox woodcut, the illustration of an instrument created to solve astrological and astronomical problems which is part of cartographer, mathematician, and astronomer Petrus Apianus’ ‘Cosmographia’, printed in 1529; and hunting scenes from ‘Ballestería y Montería’ by Alonso Martínez de Espinar, from 1644, very sought after by collectors of hunting books. He rolled them up carefully and hid them under his clothes. That same night he boarded a plane to Buenos Aires. It was the biggest robbery against the Spanish Library and its director, writer Rosa Regás, was forced to resign when, days later, it became public. Ptolemy’s world map (picture: Wikipedia) Interpol traced the stolen prints – Ptolemy’s map alone was valued at €110,000 – all the way to… Pastore. Imago Mundi, his antique bookshop, had the stolen prints on its catalogue. He had already sold some of them, over the internet, to clients in Australia and the United States. Pastore received a light sentence, consisting of community service, but the international scandal was such that, before the antique booksellers’ association could expel him, Pastore closed down Imago Mundi. His partner in the London auction, Massimo De Caro, was caught a few years later in Italy. In April 2012, it was revealed that at least 1,500 very valuable books from the 15th to 17th centuries (and maybe as many as 4,000), had disappeared from the Girolamini library in Naples, one of Italy’s oldest. De Caro had been the library’s director for 11 months, and the police found boxes with hundreds of stolen books at his house. From prison, De Caro confessed to his crime and has since cooperated with the police in order to recover the stolen copies, which had been sold for millions of dollars in the international market. Pastore’s name, as De Caro’s Argentine contact, is also mentioned in this investigation. *** Six years on from when ‘Fervor de Buenos Aires’ was returned to the Library, and 14 from the beginning of this story, Casares still bitterly regrets the damage caused to his reputation, which has never been repaired. To remember the case that ended up with him as one of the accused, he told me, depressed him. He preferred not to. He then proceeded to offer an infinite number of details, the facsimile, and the catalogue from the London auction. He assured me once more that the book returned to the Library was not the stolen one. Seeing my scepticism, he insisted: in the correction of the ‘Villa Urquiza’ poem, the line that Borges drew between the crossed out article and the proposition that replaced it (from “una” to “con“) was of a different length and inclination in the two copies. It was not necessary to have the original copy to compare; the facsimile was enough. He told me he had handed it to the court to make the comparison, but they did not do it due to ignorance or lack of interest. His explanation was, at best, improbable: if he had seen the stolen book in Pastore’s hand, it was clear that Pastore had kept it. His background, and that of his partner De Caro, seemed to confirm it. Also, Peña, the original owner, had recognised it as his own. As if this was not enough, Vaccaro, the other complainant, had assured me that a few years after the scandal over the failed auction, Pastore had lunch with him and told him “the truth”: the book was, in effect, the one stolen from the library, but it had been bought in good faith from John Wronosky, an antique bookseller from Boston who offers Borges manuscripts (whose authenticity has been called into question by some collectors) for up to half a million dollars. As I was out of Buenos Aires for a few months, I asked a literature student to go to the Library, request the recovered copy, and send me a copy of the ‘Villa Urquiza’ page. Surprisingly, after some toing and froing, they did not allow him to see it. Were they hiding it? I then wrote to the director, Horacio González: they were telling me the recovered book was not the one that had been stolen. Was this true? To my surprise, González replied: “It is true. ‘Fervor de Buenos Aires’, first edition, is a recovered book that does not seem to be the one that was stolen.” Laura Rosato, in charge of the Borges collection, who was copied on the e-mail, confirmed it: it was, indeed, another book. Where had this copy come from? What happened to the stolen one? No one knew. “Next time someone comes to me with a stolen book,” said Casares bitterly, “I will just shut up.”"	"Literature; TOP STORY; antique books; art trafficking; Jorge Luis Borges; National Library"	"http://www.argentinaindependent.com/top-story/fake-borges/"	"2014-02-17 15:58:32"	"2014-02-17 15:58:10"	"85"	"General"	"argentina independent"
